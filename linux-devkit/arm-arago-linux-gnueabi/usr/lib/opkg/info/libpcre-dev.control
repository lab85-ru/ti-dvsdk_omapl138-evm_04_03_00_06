Package: libpcre-dev
Version: 7.6-r8.6
Description: Perl-compatible regular expression library. PCRE has its own native API, but a set of 'wrapper' functions that are based on the POSIX API are also supplied in the library libpcreposix. Note that this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE; the regular expressions themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The header file for the POSIX-style functions is called pcreposix.h.
