How to build TI GStreamer plug-ins with an external (non-DVSDK) build
system 
=====================================================================

Since there are multiple build systems supported by DMAI and this TI
GStreamer plug-in, the project ships a simple build system to build the
minimal required libraries using a DVSDK appropiate for the platform
(DM6467, OMAP3, etc) of interest.

You can also build the TI GStreamer plug-in in whatever build system you
are using.  The file Makefile.external is a good reference for building
with an external build system.  Other build systems, like RidgeRun SDK
and OpenEmbedded, already provide this type of integration.

The Makefile.external can be called with 'make -f Makefile.external" and
you need to provide the following environment variables to make it work:

- Standard environment variables for locating the compiler, linker and
flags for your compiler or cross-compiler (CC, LD, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS). 

- Environment variable PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR setup to the location of the
pkg-config definitions for the gstreamer packages used in your build
system.

- Environment variable DVSDK_PATH for the location of your DVSDK. The
DVSDK should have been built already.

- If your DVSDK doesn't include DMAI, then set the DMAI_INSTALL_DIR
variable to the location of the DMAI package you want to use for
building the plug-ins. The DMAI should have been built already.
