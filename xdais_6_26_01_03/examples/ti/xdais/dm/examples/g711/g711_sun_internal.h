 * Each biased linear code has a leading 1 which identifies the segment
 * number. The value of the segment number is equal to 7 minus the number
 * of leading 0's. The quantization interval is directly available as the
 * four bits wxyz.  * The trailing bits (a - h) are ignored.
 *
 * Ordinarily the complement of the resulting code word is used for
 * transmission, and so the code word is complemented before it is returned.
