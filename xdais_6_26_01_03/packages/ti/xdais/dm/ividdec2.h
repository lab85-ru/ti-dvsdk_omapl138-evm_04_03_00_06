 *              (@c outArgs->displayBufs) could still be returned.
 *              The codec can indicate that buffers are available by

 *              also be sure to set the #XDM_ISFATALERROR bit in the
 *              respective @c extendedError fields.  Failure to do so may

 *              into which the algorithm will write MB data for each macro
 *              block.  The size of the MB data buffer will vary based on the
 *              decoder type.  H.264 may generate N264 bytes per MB, while
 *              Mpeg2 may generate NMP2 bytes.  The exact size of the buffers

 *  @brief      Control behavior of an algorithm.
 *
 *  @param[in]  handle          Handle to an algorithm instance.
 *  @param[in]  id              Command id.  See #XDM_CmdId.
 *  @param[in]  params          Dynamic parameters.  This is a required
 *                              parameter.
 *  @param[out] status          Output results.  This is a required parameter.
 *
 *  @pre        @c handle must be a valid algorithm instance handle.
 *
 *  @pre        @c params must not be NULL, and must point to a valid
 *              IVIDDEC2_DynamicParams structure.
 *
 *  @pre        @c status must not be NULL, and must point to a valid
 *              IVIDDEC2_Status structure.
 *
 *  @pre        If a buffer is provided in the @c status->data field,
 *              it must be physically contiguous and owned by the calling
 *              application.
 *
 *  @post       The algorithm <b>must not</b> modify the contents of @c params.
 *              That is, the data pointed to by this parameter must be
 *              treated as read-only.
 *
 *  @post       If a buffer was provided in the @c status->data field,
 *              it is owned by the calling application.
