/*
 *  Configure L1D Cache and L1DSRAM segment: l1DMode
 *
 *  OMAP3530 device has 48KB of physical memory at 0x10F04000 available
 *  as internal RAM, called the "L1DSRAM" segment in BIOS, and it has
 *  another adjacent 32KB at 0x10F10000 that can either be used entirely
 *  for L1D cache, or split between L1D cache and more internal memory.
 *
 *  The 80KB segment (48KB + 32KB) starts at 0x10F04000. When powered on,
 *  the device uses the upper 32K for L1D cache entirely, so BIOS by default
 *  defines the L1DSRAM segment to be 48KB long and does not change the cache.
 *
 *  We can change the default behavior, by shrinking the L1D cache and adding
 *  the extra space to L1DSRAM. We can set the L1D cache to be 32K (the default)
 *  or 16K, 8K, 4K, or 0K. The corresponding L1DSRAM sizes then are 48K (the
 *  default), or 64K, 72K, 76K, or 80K.
 *
 *  The L1DSRAM segment always starts at 0x10F04000.
 *
 *  Configure L2 Cache memory settings: l2Mode
 *
 *  This value indicates how the physical internal memory of size 64KB
 *  starting at 0x10800000 will be split between L2 cache and a
 *  general-purpose internal memory segment IRAM.
 *
 *  The options for l2Mode are:
 *
 *  "0k"  -- IRAM    : start = 0x10800000, len = 64KB
 *           L2 Cache: none
 *  "32k" -- IRAM    : start = 0x10800000, len = 32KB
 *           L2 Cache: start = 0x10808000, len = 32KB
 *  "64k" -- IRAM    : none
 *           L2 Cache: start = 0x10800000, len = 64KB
