<h1>Codec Engine 1.10 Release</h1>
<p>
This Codec Engine Release is targetted to the DaVinci platforms,
enabling users to instantiate and utilize both local and remote codecs.
In addition to the heterogenous DM644x devices, it supports single
processor environments as well; specifically Joule
devices, ARM9 devices running Linux and x86 devices running Linux.

<h2><a name="General_Info">General Information</a></h2>
<p>
The Codec Engine is a software platform for algorithm execution that
satisfies the following, high-level goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Robust</b> - drives pre-integrated components with fully
characterized performance.</li>
  <li><b>Easy to use</b> - app developers specify <i>what</i> needs to
be run, but not <i>how</i> or <i>where</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Extensible and Configurable</b> - new algorithms can be added
by anyone, using standard tools and techniques.</li>
  <li><b>Portable</b> - API's are target, platform, and in many cases
  even codec independant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Codec Engine consists of the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce</tt></b> - The Codec Engine runtime.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.video</tt></b> - The Codec Engine video component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.image</tt></b> - The Codec Engine image component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.speech</tt></b> - The Codec Engine speech/voice component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.audio</tt></b> - The Codec Engine audio component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.osal</tt></b> - The Codec Engine OS Abstraction
  Layer.  This package insulates CE from the OS it's running on, and
  provides a few Modules for customers to use (e.g. Memory).</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.utils.trace</tt></b> - The Codec Engine utility
  package for trace.  This includes the TraceUtils module.  This makes
  tracing features easier to use by an application.  It will be
  supported in this release, but may be replaced in a future release
  with an incompatible implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, this release of the Codec Engine supports the xDM 1.0
beta interfaces included in xDAIS 5.10.  This support is provided in
the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.video1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine video 1.0 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.0 beta interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.image1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine image 1.0 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.0 beta interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.speech1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine speech 1.0 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.0 beta interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.audio1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine audio 1.0 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.0 beta interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>
<p>
The Codec Engine packages are available in the "packages/"
subdirectory of the product.  If you have a previous release of the
Codec Engine product, you can install this release next to it, and
modify your application and/or server builds to use this newer release.</p>
<p>
If you're using the DVEVM, this can be done by setting the
<b>CE_INSTALL_DIR</b> variable in the <tt>Rules.make</tt> file at the
top of the DVEVM distribution directory.</p>

<h2><font color="red">Compatibility Breaks!</font></h2>
<p>
Some of the components Codec Engine builds upon have evolved and
broken compatibility with previous releases.  Specifically, DSP/BIOS
and some components within the XDC tools.  As a result, the customer
upgrading from CE 1.02 to CE 1.10 may experience some of the following
errors if they aren't using the correct versions of CE dependent components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  When building a DSP-side executable, if you haven't updated to
  BIOS 5.31.01 (or compatible), you may encounter a build error
  similar to the following:<br><br>
  <pre>
    js: "/home/user/dvevm_1_10/xdctools_1_21/packages/xdc/cfg/cfg.js",
    line 143: exception from uncaught JavaScript throw: Error:
    incompatible use of package 'ti.bios', imported version
    [5,2,2,20], ti.bios.utils was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11],
    ti.sdo.ce.osal was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11],
    ti.sdo.fc.dskt2 was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11],
    ti.sdo.fc.dman3 was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11],
    ti.sdo.fc.acpy3 was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11],
    ti.sdo.ce.bioslog was built with version [5, 2, 3, 11]
  </pre>
  You'll need to update your build to utilize a version of DSP/BIOS
  compatible with BIOS 5.31.01.
  </li>
  <li>
    The GCC Monta Vista target (used to build ARM-side executables) has
    broken compatibility in order to add support for Monta Vista's
    Windows build environment.  This change requires CE 1.10 customers
    to update to the XDC tools provided in BIOS 5.31.01 or later.  You
    can set <b>XDC_INSTALL_DIR</b> to your environment's
    <tt>bios_5_31_01/xdctools</tt>.<br><br>
    Failure to update to
    these new xdctools may result in strange errors when building the
    updated examples, like the following:
    <pre>
    /db/toolsrc/library/vendors2005/mvl/arm/mvl4.0-new/montavista/pro
    /devkit/arm/v5t_le/bin/../lib/gcc/armv5tl-montavista-linuxeabi/3.
    4.3/../../../../armv5tl-montavista-linuxeabi/bin/ld:./ceapp_packa
    ge/package/cfg/pkg_x470MV.xdl: file format not recognized; treati
    ng as linker script
    /db/toolsrc/library/vendors2005/mvl/arm/mvl4.0-new/montavista/pro
    /devkit/arm/v5t_le/bin/../lib/gcc/armv5tl-montavista-linuxeabi/3.
    4.3/../../../../armv5tl-montavista-linuxeabi/bin/ld:./ceapp_packa
    ge/package/cfg/pkg_x470MV.xdl:2: parse error
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    </pre>
    Breaks occurred in 2 places; the examples have been updated to
    reflect these changes:
    <ol>
      <li>
      The <b>rootDir</b> configuration has "moved up" one level.
      Codec Engine users typically configure this in <b>user.bld</b>,
      and will have to set this variable one directory higher than
      previous releases.
      </li>
      <li>
      The format of the autogenerated linker command file (with the
      <b>.xdl</b> extension) has changed in format.  As a result, when
      adding this file to an application's link line, rather than the
      previous technique of "cat'ing" the contents of the file onto
      the link line, you now simply provide the name of the file.
      <br><br>
      That is, rather than the previous technique:
      <pre>
      $(LINK) `BKTK`cat $(XDL_FILE)`BKTK`
      </pre>
      do this instead:
      <pre>
      $(LINK) $(XDL_FILE)
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>
<p>The following significant changes have been made since 1.00.</p>

<h3>1.10 (This Release)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to C6x Codegen 6.0.7</li>
      <li>Updated to DSP/BIOS 5.31.01</li>
      <li>Updated to Framework Components 1.10.01</li>
      <li>Updated to xDAIS 5.10, which includes xDM 1.0 beta
      interfaces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CE Runtime
    <ul>
      <li>Added new methods to <tt>ti.sdo.ce.ICodec</tt> interface
      (<tt>getCreationStackSize()</tt>,
      <tt>getDaramScratchSize()</tt>, and
      <tt>getSaramScratchSize()</tt>) to make Server configuration
      easier.  When codecs implement these methods, the XDC Config Kit
      is able to either:
        <ol>
          <li>Auto-generate the DSKT2 scratch configuration, or</li>
          <li>Validate the scratch config (if the server integrator
      wants to continue explicitly configuring those values).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VISA
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for xDM 1.0 Beta interfaces.  (Previous xDM
      0.9 interfaces continue to be supported)
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SPI (System Programming Interfaces)
    <ul>
      <li>Added <tt>VISA_setContext()</tt> and
      <tt>VISA_getContext()</tt> services for stub/skeleton/API authors.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Added "Adapter" application note describing how to integrate
      non-xDM codecs, as well as a technique for adding pre- and post-
      processing steps to existing codecs without modifying them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Examples
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added new, Linux-only example demonstrating how users can
        create a shared library from a single configuration, which can
        then be used by multiple applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a new example, explicitly describing the steps taking
        during configuration to better demonstrate the necessary
        configuration steps for users who want to integrate this into
        their own, custom build flows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modified example codecs, when possible, to utilize copy
        codecs now distributed in xDAIS 5.10.  In this way, it's more
        clearly described what little XDC packaging is required to
        integrate an already XDC packaged Codec (independant of CE) into
        the CE framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defects
    <ul>
      <li>SDSCM00010422 - CE and CMEM should set the close-on-exec
      flag on any open file handles</li>
      <li>SDSCM00005810 - Additional C++ testing required</li>
      <li>SDSCM00004993 - GT no longer supports wildcards as second
      character</li>
      <li>SDSCM00004805 - GT computes (a lot) during GT_?trace()</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enhancements
    <ul>
      <li>SDSCM00010364 - GT needs productized</li>
      <li>SDSCM00008121 - not possible to properly size RMS thread's
      stack</li>
      <li>SDSCM00007887 - Support VISA_getContext/setContext SPIs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00006616 - CE should ensure unique UUIDs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00003992 - Add pre- and/or post- process example to
      codecs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00002920 - ICodec should have a getScratchSize method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>1.02</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General
    <ul>
      <li>Introduced <tt>ti.sdo.ce.utils.trace.TraceUtils</tt>
      module.</li>
      <li>Libraries are now provided in release builds.  Previously,
      they were debug-only.</li>
      <li>Introduced <tt>Engine_setTrace()</tt> API.</li>
      <li>Added support for C++</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VISA Classes
    <ul>

<h3>1.01</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General
    <ul>
      <li>Many trace strings were modified/added.</li>
      <li>C64P libraries built with 6.0.3 compiler.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VISA Classes
    <ul>
      <li>Audio Encoding support has been added</li>
      <li>Better compliance checking of "size" field.  This field
      <i>must</i> be set correctly in the various VISA APIs, as it is
      now used to determine how much data to provide to the
      codecs.</li>
      <li>Related to previous bullet, added extended xDM support to
      VIDDEC, VIDENC, AUDDEC, IMGDEC, and SPHDEC classes.  There are
      limits to the size of the extended structures, and they must not
      contain pointers in the extended structures.</li>
      <li>outArgs fixed to be provided in the case of a failed
      process() call (enabling inspection of extendedError).</li>
      <li>Removed cache alignment validation of input buffers.  When the
      application can ensure cache coherence, these buffers need not be
      aligned.</li>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>

<h3>xDM 1.0 beta Support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The VISA 1.0 classes reflecting the xDM 1.0 beta interfaces don't
    support "sparse" XDM_BufDesc structures.  They support multiple
    buffers in XDM_BufDesc, but they must start at index 0 and end at
    index numBufs - 1.  See the xDM 1.0 beta Reference Guide for more
    details on the sparse nature of the XDM_BufDesc structure.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>x86 Linux support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for "native Linux" (x86) in the examples has been disabled
    in examples/user.bld by default.  Build validation on some Linux
    distributions failed, and as such it was removed from the
    examples.  (Note that the examples ran, so this appears to be
    purely build related, and is related to the fact that different
    distributions place codegen in different locations).  Because it's
    a popular feature, and works on many
    distributions, the Codec Engine libraries for x86 are still
    distributed, but this platform is not currently officially
    supported.  We're working to resolve the issues and restore
    functionality in a future Codec Engine release.
  </li>
