<h1 align="center">Codec Engine 2.00 Release Notes </h1>
<h2 align="center">October 2007</h2>

<p>
This Codec Engine Release is targetted to the DaVinci platforms,
enabling users to instantiate and utilize both local and remote codecs.
In addition to heterogenous devices (e.g. DM644x), it supports single
processor environments as well; specifically C64+ devices (e.g. DM643x,
and DM648), ARM9 devices running Linux (e.g. DM355) and x86 devices running
Linux.

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The Codec Engine is a software platform for algorithm execution that
satisfies the following, high-level goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Robust</b> - drives pre-integrated components with fully
characterized performance.</li>
  <li><b>Easy to use</b> - app developers specify <i>what</i> needs to
be run, but not <i>how</i> or <i>where</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Extensible and Configurable</b> - new algorithms can be added
by anyone, using standard tools and techniques.</li>
  <li><b>Portable</b> - API's are target, platform, and in many cases
  even codec independant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Codec Engine consists of the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce</tt></b> - The Codec Engine runtime.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.video1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine video 1.00 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.00 interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.image1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine image 1.00 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.00 interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.speech1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine speech 1.00 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.00 interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.audio1</tt></b> - The Codec Engine audio 1.00 component
  (supporting the xDM 1.00 interfaces).  Both encode and decode
  are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.osal</tt></b> - The Codec Engine OS Abstraction
  Layer.  This package insulates CE from the OS it's running on, and
  provides a few Modules for customers to use (e.g. Memory).</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.utils.trace</tt></b> - The Codec Engine utility
  package for trace.  This includes the TraceUtils module.  This makes
  tracing features easier to use by an application.  It will be
  supported in this release, but may be replaced in a future release
  with an incompatible implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, this release of the Codec Engine continues to support
the deprecated xDM 0.9 interfaces included in xDAIS 5.00.  This
support is provided in the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.video</tt></b> - The Codec Engine video component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.image</tt></b> - The Codec Engine image component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.speech</tt></b> - The Codec Engine speech/voice
  component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.ce.audio</tt></b> - The Codec Engine audio component.
  Both encode and decode are supported, and an example is provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>
<p>The following significant changes have been made since 1.00</p>

<div class="memitem">
<h3>2.00  (This Release)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
      <li>In Linux-based applications, Codec Engine is now callable from
        multiple processes.  For environments that require DSP/BIOS Link
        (e.g. DM644x), users must use Link 1.40.05 P3.  For single
        processor environments (e.g. DM355), no special instructions are
        required.  Note that, as always, codecs that
        share resources must be configured into the same scratch group.  These
        scratch groups span processes - so if two different apps use codecs
        that share resources, the system integrator must ensure they are placed
        into the same <i>system-wide</i> scratch group.
      </li>
      <li>Support for the new IVIDTRANSCODE xDM API has been added.  This
        provides a standard API for invoking video transcoding algorithms.
        See the Reference Guide for details.
      </li>
      <li>Added cache management configuration to xDM 0.9-based <i>remote</i>
        image and video algorithms.  Using this feature, it is possible to
        configure these interfaces to <i>not</i> writeback the output data
        buffers if, for example, these are being moved between internal and
        external (shared) memory using DMA.  This can significantly improve
        performance of remote process() calls, as writing back large video or
        image buffers is time consuming.  See the Configuration Reference Guide,
        specifically the
        <tt>ti.sdo.ce.video.VIDDECConfig</tt>/<tt>.VIDENCConfig</tt>
        (and similar modules in the <tt>ti.sdo.ce.image</tt> package) for
        details.
      </li>
      <li>Applications can create <i>remote</i> instances of the same algorithm
        to run at different priorities.  This enables applications to have,
        for example, background transcoding or encoding tasks running alongside
        real-time encode or decode operations that use the same codec.
        This is handled by adding the priority to the codec name during
        creation (e.g. "mpeg3dec:4").  See the Application Developer's Guide
        and API Reference Guide for details.
      </li>
      <li>Improved trace usability with new <tt>CE_DEBUG</tt> environment
        variable.  See the Application Developer's Guide for details.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Updated Dependencies
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to xDAIS 6.00</li>
      <li>Updated to Framework Components 2.00</li>
      <li>Updated to CMEM 2.00</li>
      <li>Updated to XDC 3.00.01</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<div class="memitem">
<h3>1.20</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to xDAIS 5.21, which includes xDM 1.00 interfaces</li>
      <li>Updated to DSP/BIOS Link 1.40.05 - this resulted in some
      necessary configuration-related changes</li>
      <li>Updated to Framework Components 1.20.02</li>
      <li>Updated to new XDC Tools 2.93.01</li>
      <li>Updated to CMEM 1.04</li>
      <li>Added examples for single-processor, environments (e.g. DM643x) -
      this includes placing executables into platform-specific directories,
      as well as demonstrating necessary caching techniques for cache-enabled
      environments.</li>
      <li>Added Link Arbiter Daemon (LAD)</li>
      <li>Added CERuntime_exit() for applications which want to erase any
      CE Runtime from their environment without exiting their application.
      This is useful if, for example, an application wants to switch between
      a Codec Engine based environment, and a custom DSP Link-based framework.
      </li>
      <li>Moved examples into "Codec Engine-specific" namespaces (e.g., the
      previous <b>codecs.viddec1_copy</b> codec package is now the
      <b>ti.sdo.ce.examples.codecs.viddec1_copy</b> package).
      </li>
      <li>Added configuration option to xDM 0.9-based video encoders
      to <i>not</i> manage the cache for the reconstruction buffers.
      </li>
      <li>Added 'checked' builds to the distribution.  This enables
      some parameter and usage validation to occur within the CE
      framework, helping to identify common coding errors in both
      applications and algorithms.  Enabling this optional feature
      introduces some performance overhead, but is encouraged for
      those early in development.  This can be enabled in the
      application configuration, as well as the Server (for systems
      with remote algorithms).  See the documentation on the
      <tt>ti.sdo.ce.Settings</tt> Module's "checked" parameter in the
      Configuration Reference Guide.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>BIOS-based environments
    <ul>
      <li>Added LOG_events for profiling performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The following defects were resolved:

<h3>1.10</h3>
<ul>
  <li>General
    <ul>
      <li>Updated to C6x Codegen 6.0.7</li>
      <li>Updated to DSP/BIOS 5.31.01</li>
      <li>Updated to Framework Components 1.10.01</li>
      <li>Updated to xDAIS 5.10, which includes xDM 1.00 beta
      interfaces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CE Runtime
    <ul>
      <li>Added new methods to <tt>ti.sdo.ce.ICodec</tt> interface
      (<tt>getCreationStackSize()</tt>,
      <tt>getDaramScratchSize()</tt>, and
      <tt>getSaramScratchSize()</tt>) to make Server configuration
      easier.  When codecs implement these methods, the XDC Tools
      are able to either:
        <ol>
          <li>Auto-generate the DSKT2 scratch configuration, or</li>
          <li>Validate the scratch config (if the server integrator
      wants to continue explicitly configuring those values).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VISA
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for xDM 1.00 Beta interfaces.  (Previous xDM
      0.9 interfaces continue to be supported)
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SPI (System Programming Interfaces)
    <ul>
      <li>Added <tt>VISA_setContext()</tt> and
      <tt>VISA_getContext()</tt> services for stub/skeleton/API authors.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Added "Adapter" application note describing how to integrate
      non-xDM codecs, as well as a technique for adding pre- and post-
      processing steps to existing codecs without modifying them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Examples
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added new, Linux-only example demonstrating how users can
        create a shared library from a single configuration, which can
        then be used by multiple applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a new example, explicitly describing the steps taking
        during configuration to better demonstrate the necessary
        configuration steps for users who want to integrate this into
        their own, custom build flows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modified example codecs, when possible, to utilize copy
        codecs now distributed in xDAIS 5.10.  In this way, it's more
        clearly described what little XDC packaging is required to
        integrate an already XDC packaged Codec (independant of CE) into
        the CE framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defects
    <ul>
      <li>SDSCM00010422 - CE and CMEM should set the close-on-exec
      flag on any open file handles</li>
      <li>SDSCM00005810 - Additional C++ testing required</li>
      <li>SDSCM00004993 - GT no longer supports wildcards as second
      character</li>
      <li>SDSCM00004805 - GT computes (a lot) during GT_?trace()</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enhancements
    <ul>
      <li>SDSCM00010364 - GT needs productized</li>
      <li>SDSCM00008121 - not possible to properly size RMS thread's
      stack</li>
      <li>SDSCM00007887 - Support VISA_getContext/setContext SPIs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00006616 - CE should ensure unique UUIDs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00003992 - Add pre- and/or post- process example to
      codecs</li>
      <li>SDSCM00002920 - ICodec should have a getScratchSize method</li>

<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>
<p>
The Codec Engine packages are available in the "packages/"
subdirectory of the product.  If you have a previous release of the
Codec Engine product, you can install this release next to it, and
modify your application and/or server builds to use this newer release.</p>
<p>
If you're using the DVEVM, this can be done by setting the
<b>CE_INSTALL_DIR</b> variable in the <tt>Rules.make</tt> file at the
top of the DVEVM distribution directory.</p>

<h2><font color="red">Compatibility Breaks!</font></h2>
<ul>
  <li>CE 2.00 requires system integrators to update to XDC Tools 3.00.01
    (or newer).
  </li>
  <li><tt>Memory_getPhysicalAddress()</tt> was previously an internal,
    undocumented function, but was used by many customers as the DVSDK program
    called it from their demo apps.  CE <i>does</i> have a more powerful,
    and supported API - <tt>Memory_getBufferPhysicalAddress()</tt> that
    customers should be using.  To support backward compatibility with users
    of <tt>Memory_getPhysicalAddress()</tt>, we added a static inline version
    of this API to the Memory.h header - but users must define
    <tt>ti_sdo_ce_osal_Memory_USEDEPRECATEDAPIS</tt> before
    <tt>#include &lt;ti/sdo/ce/osal/Memory.h&gt;</tt>.  This can be done

<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>
<p>
Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product
numbers and are intended to:
<ol>
  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components,
  and</li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to
  set end user expectations.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R
- where:
<ul>
  <li><b>M = Major</b>.  A difference in M indicates a break in
  compatibility.</li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>.  A difference in S indicates source
  compability.  That is, the user's source doesn't require change, but
  <i>does</i> require rebuilding.</li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>.  A difference in R indicates an introduction
  of new features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not
  broken.  If libraries are provided by the package, an application
  must re-link with the new libraries, but not rebuild from source.</li>
</ul>
