/**

 *
 *  @brief      Describes the interface to the SDMA manager.
 *
 *  The sdma user interface library wraps file system calls to an associated
 *  kernel module (sdmak.ko), which needs to be loaded in order for calls to
 *  to this library to succeed.
 *
 *  To install sdmak.ko, enter
 *      % insmod sdmak.ko
 *  on a Linux command line.
 *
 *  SDMA channels are allocated (requested) from within the sdmak kernel
 *  driver through the SDMA_getChannels() API.  This request is granted by
 *  way of the kernel's request_dma() functionality (omap_request_dma() for
 *  the OMAP35x), so it will work in conjuntion with independent kernel DMA
 *  usage without conflict or custom kernel configuration.  The granted
 *  channel's registers are memory-mapped into the calling user address
 *  space to allow the application to directly access the DMA registers for
 *  that channel.
 *
 *  A DMA callback ISR is registered within the stock kernel DMA manager, and
 *  this ISR is used for completion notification (although it could be
 *  customized to handle any DMA-generated interrupt).  Notification to the
 *  user interface layer is accomplished by way of a user state structure
 *  whose address is passed to the sdmak kernel driver and which is directly
 *  written upon completion.  Atomic hand-shaking allows the kernel driver to
 *  know if the application is going to wait for the completion by way of the
 *  corresponding sdmak ioctl(), as opposed to just checking the user state
 *  structure, and post a channel-specific mutex only when needed (otherwise
 *  just the completion flag in the state structure is set).
 *
 *  Since the SDMA interface library doesn't use the GT tracing facility,
 *  there is one configuration option available for the SDMA module to control
 *  whether the debug or release interface library is used for building the
 *  application.  This config parameter is named 'debug' and is of type bool,
 *  and the default value is 'false'.
 *
 *  The following line is an example of enabling usage of the debug interface
 *  library:
 *      var sdma = xdc.useModule('ti.sdo.linuxutils.sdma.SDMA');
 *      sdma.debug = true;
 *  This will enable "SDMA Debug" statements to be printed to stdout.
