 * Tests the address translation. Inserting CMEM with the following
 * options works on the DVEVM (if mem=120M):
 *
 * insmod cmemk.ko phys_start=0x87800000 phys_end=0x88000000 pools=1x3145728 
 *
 * You should see lots of address translations on screen keeping "even steps"
 * as the increase (same offset).
