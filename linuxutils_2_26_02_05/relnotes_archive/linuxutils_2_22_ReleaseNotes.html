<h1 align="center">Linux Utils 2.22 Release Notes </h1>
<h2 align="center">January 2009</h2>

<p>
This Linux Utils Release is targetted for the various DaVinci- and OMAP-based 
platforms running Linux, but is generally usable for any Linux-based system.

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The Linux Utils utility package provides the ability for user-mode
applications to access the CMEM, EDMA, SDMA, and VICP utility libraries.
</p>

<h3><a name="CMEM">CMEM</a></h3>

<p>
The CMEM (Contiguous Memory) utility library provides the ability for
user-mode applications to allocate and free blocks of physically contiguous
memory.  This is typically done to manage multimedia data buffers which
will be worked on by multimedia algorithms, but the memory provided by this
library can be used for any purpose.
</p>

<p>
The reason multimedia algorithms often require physically contiguous
memory is that sometimes they're on another processor which may not
contain an MMU (e.g. the C64P processor on a DM644x device), and/or
Linux-based algorithms utilize hardware accelerators (e.g. DMA, image
co-processors, etc) which don't access memory through an MMU.
</p>

<p>
The CMEM module consists of the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.cmem</tt></b> - The CMEM user-mode library and
  kernel mode driver.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The CMEM module supports the following devices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>all supported platforms for this release</tt></b></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="SDMA">SDMA</a></h3>

<p>
SDMA refers to the "System DMA" incorporated on the OMAP35x family of devices.
</p>

<p>
The SDMA utility library provides the ability for user-mode
applications to request SDMA channels and operate on a channel using direct,
memory-mapped access to the channel's DMA registers (Framework Components
contains a layer named SCPY to manage this direct access).  It also provides
"blocking" support for waiting for the completion of a transfer on a
particular channel.
</p>

<p>
Performing direct DMA register access helps to alleviate the overhead of
initiating, and checking completion of, DMA transfers, since the usual method
involves calling down into the Linux kernel somehow.  Transfer completion
checking is achieved by first querying an application status flag, and only
when it is known that the transfer is NOT complete will a blocking kernel
module call be made.
</p>

<p>
The SDMA module consists of the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.sdma</tt></b> - The SDMA user-mode library and
  kernel mode driver.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The SDMA module supports the following devices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>OMAP3530</tt></b></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="EDMA">EDMA</a></h3>

<p>
EDMA refers to the "Enhanced DMA" incorporated on the Davinci family of
C64+ devices.
</p>

<p>
The EDMA utility library provides the ability for user-mode
applications to request EDMA channels and operate on a channel using direct,
memory-mapped access to the channel's DMA registers (Framework Components
contains a layer named ACPY3 to manage this direct access).  It also provides
"blocking" support for waiting for the completion of a transfer on a
particular channel.
</p>

<p>
Performing direct DMA register access helps to alleviate the overhead of
initiating, and checking completion of, DMA transfers, since the usual method
involves calling down into the Linux kernel somehow.  Transfer completion
checking is achieved by first querying an application status flag, and only
when it is known that the transfer is NOT complete will a blocking kernel
module call be made.
</p>

<p>
The EDMA module consists of the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.edma</tt></b> - The EDMA user-mode library and
  kernel-mode driver.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The EDMA module supports the following devices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>DM355</tt></b></li>
  <li><b><tt>DM365</tt></b></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="VICP">VICP</a></h3>

<p>
VICP refers to the "Video Image CoProcessing" subsystem incorporated on the
Davinci family of C64+ devices.
</p>

<p>
The VICP utility library provides the ability for user-mode
applications to request VICP channels and operate on a channel using direct,
memory-mapped access to the channel's registers (Framework Components
contains a layer named VICPSYNC to manage this direct access).  It also
provides "blocking" support for waiting for the completion of a transfer on a
particular channel.
</p>

<p>
The main functionality of the VICP utility library is to provide access to
the completion interrupts of various coprocessor resources.  The VICP utility
library provides access to specific "resources" that include:
<ul>
  <li>IMX0</li>
  <li>IMX1</li>
  <li>NSF</li>
  <li>MJCP</li>
  <li>HDVICP0</li>
  <li>HDVICP1</li>
</ul>
Access to these resources is typically achieved by way of a Framework
Components resource manager that makes function calls into the VICP library.
Functional operation of the various resources is *not* part of the Linux Utils
VICP component.
</p>

<p>
The VICP module consists of the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.vicp</tt></b> - The VICP user-mode library.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.irq</tt></b> - The VICP kernel-mode driver.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The VICP module supports the following devices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>DM365</tt></b></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>
<p>
The Linux Utils packages are available in the "packages/"
subdirectory of the product.  If you have a previous release of the
Linux Utils (or CMEM) product, you can install this release next to it, and
modify your application and/or server builds to use this newer release.</p>
<p>
If you're using the DVEVM, this can be done by setting the
<b>CMEM_INSTALL_DIR</b> variable in the <tt>Rules.make</tt> file at the
top of the DVEVM distribution directory.</p>

<h2>Compatibility Breaks!</h2>
<p>None</p>

<p>
Note, if you're upgrading from a release earlier than Linux Utils 1.22, be
sure to review the <b>Upgrade</b> section for each of the releases between
your current release and this one.  Previous release notes are
available in the relnotes_archive directory.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Compatibility">Compatibility Information</a></h2>
<p>
The details provided below describe each package's compatibility with the
previous release (Linux Utils 2.21).
</p>
<p>
Note, the Configuration Reference Guide contains
further details about each package.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.cmem</tt></b> - This package is compatible
        with the previous release.
        (Compatibility key: <i>2,2,0</i> -> 2,2,0)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.sdma</tt></b> - This package is compatible
        with the previous release.
        (Compatibility key: <i>1,0,0</i> -> 1,0,0)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>ti.sdo.linuxutils.edma</tt></b> - This package is compatible

        (Compatibility key: <i>1,0,0</i> -> 1,0,0)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
If migrating from a release prior to Linux Utils 2.21, consult previous
releases available in the relnotes_archive directory.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>
<p>
Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product
numbers and are intended to:
<ol>
  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components,
  and</li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to
  set end user expectations.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R
- where:
<ul>
  <li><b>M = Major</b>.  A difference in M indicates a break in
  compatibility.</li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>.  A difference in S indicates source
  compability.  That is, the user's source doesn't require change, but
  <i>does</i> require rebuilding.</li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>.  A difference in R indicates an introduction
  of new features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not
  broken.  If libraries are provided by the package, an application
  must re-link with the new libraries, but not rebuild from source.</li>
</ul>
</p>
