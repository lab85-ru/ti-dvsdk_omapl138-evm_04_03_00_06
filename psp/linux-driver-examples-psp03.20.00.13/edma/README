EDMA sample module (edma_test.c)
_______________________________________

This is a sample kernel module, that is used to test EDMA kernel APIs.

To compile the module change to the examples/edma and issue

make -C <kernel directory> M=`pwd` ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

For more information on compiling kernel module refer to Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt in kernel tree.

To run the module, at the DUT command prompt issue:

insmod edma_test.ko

This sample application tests the EDMA instance 0. To test EDMA instance 1,
do the following modification:

1. Change the numTCs variable in the edma_test_init function of the sample
   application to 1 as EDMA instance 1 has only one TC.
2. In edma3_memtomemcpytest_dma_link function of the sample application, pass
   the first argument to edma_alloc_slot as 1.
3. In EDMA driver file under the kernel directory (arch/arm/mach-davinci/dma.c),
   modify the edma_alloc_channel function, as follows:

Change this:
....
....
if (channel < 0) {
                for (i = 0; i < EDMA_MAX_CC; i++) {
                        channel = 0;

TO:

if (channel < 0) {
                for (i = 1; i < EDMA_MAX_CC; i++) {
                        channel = 0;
....
....
