Last updated: 27 Jul 2006


The DSP/BIOS Graphical Config Package release notes are divided into four
sections, "General Info", "Fixed In This Release", "Known Issues", and
"Validation Info".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        General Information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DSP/BIOS Graphical Configuration tool (Gconf) runs both standalone and
integrated in Code Composer Studio (CCS).   The Configuration Tool is activated
in CCS by using the BIOS Selector in Component Manager.



What's new:


Limitations:

Documentation is not available in the Help system or Tconf User's Guide that
covers some of the operational details of Gconf.   This info is included here:

GTConf release notes

- Menu operations
File->Open:  Inside CCS (3.1 and newer), only tcf files can be opened with
BIOS 5.20 selected.   Running Gconf outside of CCS, Gconf is able to open both
tcf and cdb files.

When a tcf file is opened, the required tconf search path can be provided one of
three ways in the following priority order: 1) on the command line to Gconf.exe
for example by creating a shortcut, 2) through a file named tcfopts.dat which
contains the 'Tconf' commandline, 3) if no search path is specified then a
dialog will prompt the user.

Gconf will by default supply the search path to the bios 'packages' directory
from which Gconf.exe is launched unless another bios packages directory is
specified explicitly.


File->New:   Path information to the selected platform (configuration starting
point) is exported in a file, <tcffilename>.tco, in the same directory when the tcf
file is saved.


File->Save  Saves tcf files only, no bios generated files (cdb, c, asm, or
header files) are created.   This 'save' behavior is different than the previous
BIOS 4.90 cdb Gconf whose 'save' operation performed a save and generate.


File->SaveAs  In the same directory will save the tcf file with the specified
new name.  If the destination directory is different, Gconf copies all tci
files located in the original tcf directory to the destination directory,
copies tcfopts.dat file to the destination directory and resolves all relative
paths to absolute paths.   These steps are necessary to move the tconf script
context.   Even with these measures, there are cases where SaveAs will fail
such as when a script contains an import with a relative path, eg.
util.importFile("../../mytcifile")


- Gconf.ini file
The following information is saved in the directory next to gconf.exe, in
<bios install dir>\packages\ti\bios\config\gconf\bin\gconf.ini and is updated
when Gconf exits.


Hierarchy Pane, Object Pane and Script Pane positions when gconf exits.

Current seed path.   This setting can only be entered into gconf.ini manually.
The default is <bios install dir>\packages\ti\bios\config\cdb

Platform search directory.  When creating a new TCF file, you can use the
"Browse" button in the File->New dialog to point to a platform search directory
other than the default. The default is
<bios install dir>\packages.

Old seed path.  When opening a legacy CDB file, a dialog box will prompt for
the seed path of the legacy cdb being open. This is usually
<CCS install dir>\<ISA>\bios\include.  This dialog will always be displayed
when opening a legacy CDB file and will default to the most recent Old seed
path that was used.

Sample gconf.ini:

[Settings]
HierarchyPanePosition=0000000000000000FD0000008A01000088
ObjectPanePosition=0000000000000000B50000009F01000055
ScriptPanePosition=0000000000000000340100008A010000C0

[Old seed path]
TMS320C62XX=C:\CCStudio_v3.1\C6000\bios\include

[Current seed path]
TMS320C62XX=C:\bios_5_31\packages\ti\bios\config\cdb

[Platforms]
Search Directory=C:\bios_5_31\packages

- Command line options
Tconf -D<name>=<value> options can be specified on the command line when
starting gconf by using the "-tcfopts" flag:

-tcfopts="-Dconfig.importPath=.;..;../../../common; C:/bios_5_31/packages; -Dfoo=bar"

Relative paths are based on the location of the TCF file being opened.

If used inside of a Windows shortcut, quotes(") must be preceded with a
backslash(\):

-tcfopts=\"-Dconfig.importPath=.;..;../../../common; C:/bios_5_31/packages;\"

Example command line invoked in a Windows cmd shell:

gconf.exe C:\bios_5_31\packages\ti\bios\examples\basic\bigtime\dsk6713\ bigtime.tcf -tcfopts=\"-Dconfig.importPath=.;..;../../../common; C:/bios_5_31/packages;"


-Dconfig.import path usage precedence

1. Command line
2. Local tcfopts.dat
3. If none of the above are found, a dialog box will prompt for the import path


-prog.gen() rules
1. No parameter
2. Parameter allowed if not running inside of CCS
3. Parameter allowed if it matches name of current files without the ".tcf"
extension, i.e., file being opened is bigtime.tcf and prog.gen() statement is
"prog.gen(bigtime)"


- Insertion marker rules

A TCF script must have the insertion marker shown below in order for GConf to successfully
insert script statements. If a marker is not present, GConf will place one
above the "prog.gen()" statement upon the first edit operation performed.

    Insertion marker:
       // !GRAPHICAL_CONFIG_TOOL_SCRIPT_INSERT_POINT!

                       Fixed In This Release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SDSCM00010426 GConf uses latest DspBiosBuilder options when more than one
              project is opened and the projects are in the same directory 
    -GConf uses the latest DspBiosBuilder options when more than one
     project is opened and the projects are in the same directory.
     The DspBiosBuilder options are written to a file named tcfopts.dat
     when a project is opened, modified and closed. If more than one project
     reside in the same directory, then tcfopts.dat will contain the settings
     for the last project opened, which will be incorrect for any tcf file opened
     in GConf other than the one in the last project that was opened.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Known Issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SDSCM00003834 gconf uses wrong parameters when more than one pjt is opened and
              they share the same .tcf file
    -When more than one CCS project (.pjt file) share the same .tcf file, and
     two or more of the projects are opened in CCS, opening a .tcf from one of
     the projects will launch GConf using the DspBiosBuilder builder parameters
     defined for the most recently opened project. This may result in incorrect 
     base seed properties and import file paths in the .tcf file being edited. 
     To workaround, do not share .tcf files between projects.

SDSsq42752 GCONF TSK rename causes all other task's order inserted into tcf file
    -When a rename of a TSK in GCONF is performed, it actually destroys 
     the task and re-creates it with a new name.  This causes all the   
     other task's order to be inserted as well into the tcf file.

SDSsq43104 Dirty flag is cleared when a save error occurs on tcf file in CCS 3.1
    -If a script error occurs when saving a tcf file in gconf, the tcf 
     file is saved and the dirty flag is cleared. If gconf is then 
     exited in this state, the tcf file cannot be opened again without 
     resolving the error first in a text editor.  This behavior is 
     intentional to assist in debugging the resulting tcf script.

SDSsq43198 Deleting an inserted commment in script pane sometimes doesn't work
    -After inserting a comment in a tcf file using the text pane in 
     gconf, if the user right-clicks on the comment and selects edit, 
     the subsequent pop-up shows an extra space before the comment. If 
     the user then tries to delete the extra space, it has no effect on 
     the tcf file.
