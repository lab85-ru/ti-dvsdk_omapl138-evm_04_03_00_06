
    Here is a brief description of each PSL Configuration Library:

1) PSL_cfg_c5503.a55L: 
   This is the PSL configuration library for the c5503 chip.

2) PSL_cfg_c5509.a55L:
   This is the PSL configuration library for the c5509 chip. 

3) PSL_cfg_c5509a.a55L: 
   This is the PSL configuration library for the c5509a chip.

4) PSL_cfg_c5510.a55L:
   This is the PSL configuration library for the c5510 chip. 
    
5) PSL_cfg_dsk5510.a55L:
   This is the PSL configuration library for the dsk5510 board.

6) PSL_cfg_evm5509a.a55L:
   This is the PSL configuration library for the evm5509a board.


    Modify these libraries to create a custom PSL configuration.

    To build an individual library, navigate into the psl_cfg_gmake/<board> 
    directory and run the command:

    gmake

    (Note: you must first set up the common/config.mak file.) If you wish 
to build all c55x libraies navigate to the ti/psl/psl_cfg_gamke directory, 
run the command:

    gmake -f makefile,55x
