
psl_basic example

Purpose: 

This example shows how to use some of the basic functionality that
is provided by the PSL.  It shows:

  - how to initialize the PSL
  - how to change the frequency and voltage using the PSL.
  - how to determine the current frequency and voltage settings.

Design:

    In this example, when the function main() executes, PSL is initialized, 
sets an initial frequency of 200 MHz with a voltage of 1.6v.  The program then
runs func1() and prints the current frequency and voltage setting that func1()
ran at.  The program then sets frequency to 72 MHz with a voltage of 1.1v and
runs func2() and prints the current frequency and voltage setting that func2()
ran at.  The program then sets frequency to 200 MHz with a voltage of 1.6v and
runs func3() and prints the current frequency and voltage setting that func2()
ran at.
