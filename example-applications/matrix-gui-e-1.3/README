Matrix Graphical User Interface (GUI) project build instructions:

NOTE: the Makefile.build will be invoked from inside the Eclipse tool.

If building the project outside the ti-sdk environment:
 - you can use qmake to genrate the makefile
 - you can use or ignore the Makefile.build

If you wish to use Makefile.build: Build procedure outside the ti-sdk:

NOTE:  You will need to modify the Makefile.build file and set the 
       following paths:

    1.  ENV_SETUP - This should be set to the location of the 
                    environment-setup file in the Arago SDK.  You may
                    also need to modify paths in the environment-setup
                    file if building outside the SDK.
    2.  DESTDIR   - This should point to the root of your target file
                    system where you want this matrix GUI application
                    to be installed.

qmake2 // This must be invoked from the directory where the matrix_gui.pro 
          resides
