<h1> PRU - Memcopy </h1>

<p>This example executes optimized memory to memory transfers on the PRU. 
The following three cases are tests: </p>

<p>Case 1: Source and destination addresses are aligned.<br>
Case 2: Source and destination addresses are not aligned though the 
offsets of source and destination addresses from next aligned addresses are 
same.<br> 
Case 3: Source and destination addresses are not aligned, and the offsets 
of source and destination addresses from next aligned addresses are not same. </p>

<p>See the PRU Software examples project in the SDK under example-applications.
The source code for both the ARM and the PRU can be found there. </p>
