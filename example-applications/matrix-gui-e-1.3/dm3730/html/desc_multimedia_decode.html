<h1> DVSDK Decode demo Overview </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> DVSDK decode demo shows how to decode video and audio or speech using algorithms and
 the Codec Engine Engine from Texas Instruments on the DM3730 EVM.
 </p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
These algorithms implement the xDM interface and are packaged in a Codec Server that is managed by the Codec Engine. 
The algorithms are executed on the C64x DSP core. The encoded video, audio, and speech data is read from separate 
elementary streams on the Linux file system, and the decoded data is output to peripherals on the DM3730 device.
</p>

<p>
The DM3730 ARM core runs the demos on the Linux operating system, and all peripherals are 
controlled through Linux device drivers. The ARM also displays a user interface on the OSD (On 
Screen Display) and takes input from touchscreen LCD. The DSP core runs the DSP/BIOS real time operating 
system and performs algorithm processing.
