<h1> DVSDK Encode demo Overview </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> DVSDK encode demo shows how to encode video and audio or speech using algorithms and
 the Codec Engine Engine from Texas Instruments on the DM3730 EVM.
 </p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
These algorithms implement the xDM interface and are packaged in a Codec Server that is managed by the Codec Engine. 
The algorithms are executed on the C64x DSP core. The raw video and audio data is captured via Composite Input
interface and Line respectively, and the encoded data is save on the Linux file system.
</p>

<p>
The DM3730 ARM core runs the demos on the Linux operating system, and all peripherals are 
controlled through Linux device drivers. The ARM also displays a user interface on the OSD (On 
Screen Display) and takes input from touchscreen LCD,. The DSP core runs the DSP/BIOS real time operating 
system and performs algorithm processing.
