=head1 NAME

GCC::TranslationUnit - Parse the output of gcc -fdump-translation-unit

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  use GCC::TranslationUnit;

  # echo '#include <stdio.h>' > stdio.c
  # gcc -fdump-translation-unit -c stdio.c
  $node = GCC::TranslationUnit::Parser->parsefile('stdio.c.tu')->root;

  # list every function/variable name
  while($node) {
    if($node->isa('GCC::Node::function_decl') or
       $node->isa('GCC::Node::var_decl')) {
      printf "%s declared in %s\n",
        $node->name->identifier, $node->source;
    }
  } continue {
    $node = $node->chain;
  }

=head1 ABSTRACT

Provides a module for reading in the -fdump-translation-unit file from GCC
and access methods for the data available from within GCC.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Once you read in the file using the Parser, you can traverse the entire
structure of the parse tree using methods defined in the GCC::Node::*
modules. Look there for information. Each node is blessed into a
GCC::Node::* class with that name.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See the source for the GCC::Node modules, and the source to GCC itself
