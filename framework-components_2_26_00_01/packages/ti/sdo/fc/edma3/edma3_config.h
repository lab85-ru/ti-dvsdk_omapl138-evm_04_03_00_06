/**
 *  @defgroup   ti_sdo_fc_edma3_EDMA3 EDMA3
 *
 *              EDMA3 module is a Meta-config module that manages all the EDMA3
 *              resources including DMA channels, QDMA channels, PaRams, Tccs
 *              required by various users of the EDMA3 device.
 *              It also supports the notion of scratch sharing of the resources,
 *              and allows for distribution of these resources into various
 *              scratch groups for allocation to algorithms.
 *              Internally it uses the EDMA3 Low Level Driver package for
 *              managing the resources.
 *
 *  @remark     For additional information on the EDMA3 Low Level Driver, refer  *              to its documentation.
