 *              When requesting resources on a device on which DCHMAP feature
 *              does not exist, please follow these rules:-
 *              1. Break up requests into LOGICAL channel requests and requests
 *              for PaRams.             
 *              2. Logical Qdma/Edma  channel => Q/E channel + PaRam + TCC
 *              3. Avoid requesting EDMA3 resources of specific number, for
 *              most transfers an "ANY" type request should be sufficient
 *              4. For linked transfers, request a Logical channel in one
 *              descriptor, and "N" contiguous Params in another descriptor
 *              5. If a logical channel request is combined with a request for
 *              multiple Params or Tccs, this might result in an in-efficient
 *              allocation of resources, and in some cases, simplyfying 
 *              assumptions about the resource requests may be made by the
 *              allocator.
