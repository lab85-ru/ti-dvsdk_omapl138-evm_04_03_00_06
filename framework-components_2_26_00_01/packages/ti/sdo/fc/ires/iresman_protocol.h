 *              and initialize the IRES protocol's environment that will be
 *              allocated by the resource manager.
 *
 *  @remarks    These fxns are implemented by the IRES
 *              protocol that is used for a given channel (e.g, ACPY3), and
 *              are passed in the IRES_ProtocolArgs and 
 *              IRES_ResmanProtocolConstructArgs structure to request
 *              a logical resource. 
 *           
 *  @remarks    getName() - Called by the resource manager to query the name
 *              of the protocol to return to the generic Resource Manager RMAN  
 *
 *  @remarks    getRevision() - Called by the resource manager to query the  
 *              revision of the protocol to return to the generic Resource 
 *              Manager RMAN  
 *
 *  @remarks    getMemRecs() - Called by the resource manager when 
 *              creating a resource handle to query the specific resource 
 *              protocol's memory requirements.
 *              Since IRES is an abstract interface, the actual size of the 
 *              handle can be extended by the specific resource protocol.
 *
 *  @remarks    getNumMemRecs() - Called by the resource manager when 
 *              creating a logical resource handle to obtain the number of 
 *              IALG memory request descriptors the protocol uses to request 
 *              memory for the resource handle.
 *
 *  @remarks    constructHandle() - Called by the resource manager after 
 *              allocating memory for the handle, so that the resource specific
 *              custom protocol initializes the handle.
 *
 *  @remarks    destructHandle() - Called by the resource manager just before
 *              the resource is freed, to allow the custom IRES protocol to 
 *              perform any required de-initialization.
