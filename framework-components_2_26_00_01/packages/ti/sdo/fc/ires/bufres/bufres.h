 *  Buffer resource. This is a very simple example of a resource manager that
 *  implements IRES and IRESMAN interfaces. This resource manager manages a
 *  single buffer that can be shared by multiple algorithms belonging to the
 *  same scratch group (ie, the algorithms don't preempt eachother). An
 *  algorithm can request a chunk of memory with a specified length and
 *  alignment, within this buffer.
