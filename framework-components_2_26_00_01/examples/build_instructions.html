<h2>Directory Conventions</h2>
<p><i>Important</i>: throughout the rest of this document, we will use the
following notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your FC
  installation.  The FC packages are in the
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory (or repository); the
  original examples are in the <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples</tt>
  directory (or repository).</li>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your
  XDAIS installation.  Some distributions of this FC release include an
  <b>fctools</b> directory which contains an XDAIS release.  In the case of
  those distributions, <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> could be set to
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/fctools</tt>.  Note that the XDAIS packages will
  be located in the <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory
  (or repository).</li>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your
  XDC tools installation.  The FC examples now have a dependency on the XDC
  tools std.h header file. If you have installed DSP BIOS, you can set
  <tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt</tt> to <tt>&lt;BIOS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/xdctools</tt>.
  Otherwise, set <tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt</tt> to the root directory of your XDC
  tools installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing to Build the Examples</h2>
<h3>Create a working directory</h3>
<p>
Create a working directory (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages</b>) and copy the
<b>examples</b> directory into it (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages/examples</b>).
This will be where you build and modify the Framework Components examples.
</p>
<p>
Doing this will ensure you have a backup copy of the original examples, as
provided by the Framework Components product.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>Build using XDC tools</h2>
<h3>1.  Manage config.bld</h3>
<p>The Framework Components examples are also provided with XDC build scripts.  The master
build configuration script, <b>config.bld</b>, is used to define the targets
and environment in which the example XDC packages will be built.
</p>
<p>At the root of the Examples directory, there is a
<b>config.bld.default</b> config script which can be used to start from.
Simply rename it to config.bld, and open this file in a text editor.
</p>

<h4>Build.targets</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the FC examples can be built and run for different targets.
  The <b>Build.targets</b> array specifies which targets you want to build for.
  Edit this file to add/remove other targets that you would like to build the
  examples for.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Toolchain roots - rootDir</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>C64P.rootDir</b> - Specify where your C64 tools are<br>
  Edit the string (directory name) assigned to the <b>C64P.rootDir</b>
  variable. Note that both Windows and Linux builds are supported.
  Note that this the directory that contains bin/, include/, and lib/
  subdirectory.  (Note that this is only necessary if "C64P" is
  included in your "Build.targets" array). Similarly, edit the rootDir for
  other targets that the examples are built for.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Edit <b>Makefile</b> to define the necessary variables</h3>

<p>The <b>Makefile</b> file, located at the root of the examples/
directory, defines where the FC product is installed, and where the
XDC tools are. Open this file in a text editor.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specify where your FC product is installed: <br>
  Set <b>FC_INSTALL_DIR</b> to the absolute path to your FC
  installation directory.</li>
  Set <b>XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR</b> to the absolute path to your XDAIS
  installation directory. In most cases you can set it to
  $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/fctools.</li>
  <li>Specify where your XDC tools are installed:<br>
  Set <b>XDC_INSTALL_DIR</b> to the absolute
  path to your XDC tools installation directory. The version of the xdctools
  to be used is mentioned in the Makefile
  <li>Depending on the examples you are trying to build and the target you are
  building them for, you may need to specify the <b>BIOS_INSTALL_DIR</b> and
  the <b>LINUXUTILS</b> install locations.</li>
  <li>For EDMA3 tests built for the DSP, location of the Low level Resource
  Manager, <b>EDMA3_LLD_ROOT</b> will be required. In most cases, it can be
  pointed to $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/fctools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Build examples</h3>
<p>
From the base of your examples directory, type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>gmake clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmake</b></p>
Other make targets might also be available in the Makefile to build subsets of
the examples.

<hr>
<h2>Build using the provided .pjt files (dman3 fastcopy examples only)</h2>
<p>
In addition to the portable (but admittedly confusing), XDC-based
package.bld build scripts, the dman3 fastcopy examples also provide
.pjt-based builds for CCS 3 Windows users.  This section describes those
examples.
</p>
<p>
For each platform supported, there are 2
example applications provided, e.g., dm6446_bios
and dm6446_nobios.  Each includes its own .pjt file located in
their respective directories. For each of the CCS Debug and Release build
configurations, the .pjt files also support 2 more configurations: one with
the instrumented version of the ACPY3 library, and the other with the
non-instrumented version.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b>There is also a library
shared by both examples, which includes its own .pjt file
(fcpy_ti64.pjt).  Building either application will also build the
shared library.
</p>

<p>The .pjts require three variables to be
set, both are described above:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR</tt> - required for the XDAIS interface headers</li>
  <li><tt>FC_INSTALL_DIR</tt> - required for the FC interface headers</li>
  <li><tt>XDC_INSTALL_DIR</tt> - required for the XDC standard types</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can either set these variables in your system, or modify the .pjt files
with paths appropriate for your development environment.
</p>
<p>
As expected, these .pjts require CCS and only run on Windows.
</p>
