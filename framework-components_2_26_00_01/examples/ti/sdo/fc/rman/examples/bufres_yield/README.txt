Example demonstrating the use of the bufres resource by an algorithm. 
Algorithm is granted the required bufres resource via RMAN. Algorithm then uses
the bufres resource and proceeds to yield it to same or higher priority 
algorithm for use. After re-acquiring the resource, it proceeds to use it as 
before.
