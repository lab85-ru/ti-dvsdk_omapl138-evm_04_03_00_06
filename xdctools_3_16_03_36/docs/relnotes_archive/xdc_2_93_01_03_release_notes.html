<h2><a name="General_Info">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>eXpress DSP Components (XDC) is a standard for reusable software
components, optimized for real-time embedded systems. XDC components
have hardware-neutral formal interfaces, are configurable offline to
optimize memory and performance, and support custom automation in the
development environment via a scripting language.</p>

<p>XDC 2.93.01 is a patch release to XDC 2.93 that fixes a bug in the
xdc.tools.configuro package when used in combination with DSP/BIOS 5.X.
Other users, or configuro users who are not also using BIOS 5.X, do not
need this release.</p>

<p>This XDC release includes the following sets of packages: </p>

<ul>

  <li><b>XDC core (<tt>xdc.*</tt>)</b> - the <tt><b>xdc</b></tt> and
      <tt><b>xs</b></tt> command line utilities for building packages
	  and execting scripts, together with the packages that implement
	  XDC itself;</li>

  <li><b>User tools (<tt>xdc.tools.*</tt>)</b> - command-line
      and graphical utilities for working with packages and repositories;</li>

  <li><b>Targets (<tt>*.targets.*</tt>)</b> - definitions for using
      various TI and third-party compiler tool chains with XDC;</li>

  <li><b>Platforms (<tt>ti.platforms.*</tt>)</b> - definitions for
      linking and running code on various TI board-level hardware and
	  simulator products using XDC.</li>

<h3>2.93.01 (This Release)</h3>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuro Build</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in xdc.tools.configuro in supporting mixed
                XDC / BIOS 5.X tconf use case. Forced
                "config.programName" to be an absolute pathname, so that
                the tconf-generated linker script gets included correctly.
                Also added "ti.bios" package as a requirement to the
                configuro-generated package.xdc in this use case.</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->

<h3>2.93</h3>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Spec Language</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added ability to generate a custom header from a template.
		The @CustomHeader attribute now accepts an optional argument.
		If an argument is supplied it is interpreted as a template 
		that should be used (in lieu of the standard RTSC header
		file generation) to create the module's header.</li>

  <li>@CustomHeader is now interpreted for metaonly modules; this
		can be used to generate headers from metaonly modules used 
		for config.</li>

  <li>module-wide configs defined in abstract interfaces can no
		longer be accessed via proxies; in general, there was no way
		to access these given an abstract module anyway.  in cases
		where runtime access to an underlying module config is required
		via such an abstraction, a getter should then be explicitly
		spec'd in the interface.</li>

  <li>added the @TargetHeader attribute for metaonly units, allowing
		them to supply a template for generating a target-domain .h
		file.  this feature is currently used by various ITarget.xdc to
		invoke a common template used to generate various #define's
		previously passed on the command-line</li>

  <li>proxy declarations can now appear in the 'internal' section of
		an .xdc module spec, just like most other module-wide features.
		since these proxies are (in principle) not seen by the client,
		their binding is the reponsibility of the module supplier in
		their Mod.xs file; usage in both the meta- and target-domains
		is otherwise the same</li>

  <li>abstract const declarations (without initializers) appearing
		in interfaces can now be overriden in units that inherit this
		interface.  by definition, a const with an initializer is
		effectively 'final'.  any const that has not been initialized
		in a concrete module implies a @CustomHeader</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Script</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added the built-in xdc-script operators $externFxn() and
		$externPtr(), both of which take a string-valued argument that
		denotes an external symbol.  these operators should be used
		when assigning legacy code/data pointers to config params of
		type I/UArg.  this approach is preferred over the current
		'&myFxn' style of values, which would now be denoted as
		$externFxn('myFxn')</li>

  <li>change all examples to use the new $externFxn('myFxn') operator
		in lieu of '&myFxn'; see idioms/i302 for an illustration</li>


  <li>extended support for $logError functions to cfg model
		initialization so that the platform instantiation code can use
		that support; as a result, the function setExecutable() now
		returns a String which contains errors and warnings, if any</li>
</ul>		

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Boot</h4>
<ul>
  <li>if Program.system is null, two symbols from xdc.runtime.Startup
		are added to the linker command file, and set to 0; these 
		symbols are function names, and the purpose of setting these
		symbols to 0 in tha case when the functions are not linked in
		is to support new boot files; new boot files will always look
		for those symbols, but will call functions only if symbols are
		not equal to 0</li>

  <li>Added calls to Startup_reset & Startup_exec in boot files; added
		--args option and removed alloc in SECTIONS in linkcmd.xdt in
		ti.targets</li>

  <li>Added autoinit to rts5500 and rts6000</li>

  <li>Fixed the way we're calling the reset/exec functions in the boot
		file for Arm9</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Runtime</h4>
<ul>
  <li>removed __PLAT__ from xdc/runtime/std.h</li>

  <li>renamed the xdc_target__profile symbols to be xdc_bld__profile
		to distinguish this symbol from the symbols xdc_target_*
		symbols defined by std.h</li>

  <li>the type xdc.runtime.Gate.Ref is now @Encoded as a
		IGateProvider.Handle, enabling config-time assignment to state
		variables of this type by simply assigning the result of
		creating an IGateProvider instance object.  this type continues
		to be represented as an opaque pointer on the target, subject
		to manipulation by the Gate_{alloc,enter,leave,free} macros.</li>
 
  <li>added the getFreq into xdc.runtime.ITimeStamp and related
		modules</li>

  <li>removed 'name' from IHeap interface</li>

  <li>Added new type xdc.runtime.Types.FreqHz to represent ferquency
		in Hz. Used xdc.runtime.Types.FreqHz in
		xdc.runtime.ITimestampSupport and xdc.runtime.Timestamp modules.</li>

  <li>made SysMin and HeapMin thread-safe (using GATE_enterSystem),
		and made a couple of name tweaks to Gate files</li>

  <li>flushFull set to 'true' in SysMin.xdc</li>

  <li>SysMin changes:
  <ul>
		  <li>HOSTwrite 256 max problem fixed. On TI targets,
		    SysMin.bufSize greater than 256 was truncated to just 256.</li>
  		  <li>Default flushFull to false. This might impact regression
  		    tests with large amount of output via System_printf and
  		    using SysMin.</li>
		  <li>bufSize default to 1024 chars instead of 256</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Gate-protected the insertion/removal of created/deleted
		instances from their module's master linked list within
		xdc.runtime.Core, using the System gate</li>
 
  <li>added 4 IArg fields to the end of the (opaque) Error_Block
		struct for future expansion</li>
 
  <li>reworked the (recursive) implementation of Text_putRope to
		prevent "INLINE Recursion" warnings from occuring when
		Text_NOLOAD is true; this also helps reduce code size</li>
 
  <li>changed the signature of System_fail to take only a msg,
		rather than a msg + vargs; this enables a more efficient
		implementation in that only putch is called internally.
		the two known call sites for this API (Error_raise and
		Startup_exec) have been altered accordingly</li>
 
  <li>changed the signature of Log_doPrint to take a single arg of
		type Log_EventRec*, where the latter contains the log event,
		args, timestamp, and serial number.  modified LoggerSys to use
		this feature, while also adding a config param to control
		whether a timestamp is reported</li>
 
  <li>the special format specifiers %$R, %$M, and %$S have been
		removed from System_printf; current usage in xdc.runtime is
		replaced with direct calls to routines in Text.  the %$L
		specifier remains, and is used to print the label associated
		with a Handle-valued arg</li>
</ul>		

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Module Binary Contract</h4>
<ul>
  <li>arrays generated in package/cfg/*.c now are external symbols
		with a '__A' suffix in their name; this helps in understanding
		footprint issues when looking at a link map, but otherwise has
		no impact on performance</li>
</ul> 

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Targets</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added default platform for ti.targets.TMS470* targets</li>

  <li>added a parameter to Win32 target to contain the path to an
		installation of Platform SDK; Platform SDK is installed
		separately from Visual Studio, so the installation path is not
		fixed</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Platforms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added a new parameter renameMap to xdc.platform.IPlatform; the
		puprose of this parameter is to allow a simple way of changing
		the names of memory objects without redefining the whole memory
		map with 'customMemoryMap'</li>
		
  <li>added assembleMemoryMap() to xdc.platform.Utils; the function
		gathers cpu's and board's memory into a memory map and applies
		any renaming requests passed through 'renameMap'</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>ROM Support</h4>
<ul>
  <li>fixed a bug in the handling of object-offset accessors within
		the ROM flow, but treating the underlying const offset value
		not unlike any other module-wide config</li>
 
  <li>fixed a bug in the handling of proxies within the ROM flow</li>

  <li>Added .bss fix for ROM, plus NOLOAD change, to
		ti/targets/linkcmd.xdt</li>

  <li>fixed a bug in the generation of makefiles for ROM assemblies.
		the ITarget link method now receives the reflected value of the
		'isRom' attr in is 'goal' argument.  ti/targets/ITarget.xs
		factors this in when deciding to apply the "sed" hack</li>
		
  <li>changed the use of 'DSECT' to 'NOLOAD' in
		ti/targets/linkcmd.xdt when specifying the .fixedCode section
		in the final link</li>
 
  <li>fixed a ROM bug resulting from module-wide configs defined in
		interfaces that are in turn inherited by a proxy</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Build</h4>
<ul>
  <li>removed most command line -D options added by xdc.bld; they 
		are now statically defined in headers included (indirectly)
		by xdc/std.h.  Clients that build source that include 
		xdc/std.h must only need to define two symbols:
  <ul>
    <li>xdc_target_types__	- the package qualified path to the 
					  target's standard types header; e.g.,
					  ti/targets/std.h</li>
	<li>xdc_target_name__	- the name of the target without the 
					  package name</li>
  </ul></li>

  <li>fixed xdc/bld/build.dtd, and xdc/bld/release.dtd to be
		consistent with what is currently being generated</li>

  <li>added a timestamp to the end of each package's .$vers array;
		it previously contained only the compatibility key values from
		package.xdc.  With the addition of the package's release date
		timestamp, this array can now be used as a version number;
		i.e., different releases have unique $vers arrays</li>

  <li>code in xdc.cfg.Main.xs that determines the order in which the
		packages add their libraries to the linker command file is
		changes, so that the package being built gets always on the top
		of the list in the linker command file</li>

  <li>fixed release processing to not complain about require
		statements that exist solely to create a bundle</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuro Build</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Simplified the makefile usage for
		non-TI targets. The generated linker.cmd file is now a linker
		script with the correct syntax for the target. Previously some
		special processing was needed in the makefile to convert syntax
		for non-TI targets. Updated configuro examples.</li>

  <li>Added new configuro command-line options to support
		integration into CCS via BTI DLL.</li>

  <li>Changed the command line syntax for using configuro with a
		TCONF script. Previously the name of the .tcf file was given,
		and the .cfg file was inferred. Now the name of the .cfg file
		is given, and an additional "--tcf" option is used.</li>

  <li>Modified configuro to use an XDC assembly only when the profile 
		is "whole_program" and the target is a TI target.</li>
</ul>
		
<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Code Composer Studio Support</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for XDC build using Configuro to Code Composer
		Studio v3.3. This shows up as an "XDC" tab in the project
		Build Settings. Configuro build is enabled by adding a .cfg
		file to the CCS project.</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Coverity Support</h4>
<ul>
  <li>change -fs and -fr options to use -fs= and -fr= variants to 
		work around  Coverity Prevent defect number 6979</li>

  <li>fixed tisb.coverity.filters compiler config to work with
		C++ code</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In xdc.tools.Cmdr, updated command-line argument processing
		with support for long and short option names. Also if the
		config param is an array, then the option can be used multiple
		times on the command line, as in -I... .</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Assemblies</h4>
<ul>
  <li>changed condition that determines if __PLAT__ and other symbols
		in Program.xdt are included; now, Program checks for assemblies
		by checking the length of the array $$asmvec, which gets
		populated if Program imported any assemblies. If assemblies are
		imported, at least one of them included symbols. However, this
		solution does not solve the problem if Program imports more
		than one assembly, where each one of them included symbols.</li>
		
  <li>added two additional commands for a compilation goal where an
		assembly is built in 'whole_program' profile.  In that case,
		the linker creates non-relocatable partially linked file, and
		depending on the section order, linking such a file in the
		final linker step can generate errors. The implemented solution
		uses the optimized assembly file that the linker also generates
		and compiles that assembly file to create a relocatable object
		file, with all optimizations we need. Then, the compiled file
		replaces the file that the linker initially generated.</li>
</ul>



<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XGCONF Graphical Configuration</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Added checks for script text lines that the xgconf
        parser does not support. If found the script is
        marked as non-parsable. If the user performs an
        edit action a golden watermark is appended to the
        file and it is reparsed prior to executing the action.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Compatibility">Upgrade and Compatibility Information</a></h2>

<ul>

  <li><b><tt>ti.targets</tt></b> - This package is compatible with the 
  previous release. (Compatibility key: 1,0,0,0 -&gt; 1,0,0,<font color="red"><b>1</b></font>) 
  </li>
  <li><b><tt>gnu.targets</tt></b> - This package is compatible with the 
  previous release. (Compatibility key: 1,0,0,0 -&gt; 1,0,0,<font color="red"><b>1</b></font>) 
  </li>
</ul>


<p><b>Warning:</b> Beginning with xdc-o02, internal C files generated when
    building package schemas are
    named package_&lt;package name&gt;.c instead of &lt;package_name&gt;.c.
    This may introduce incompatibilities with older xdc-n and xdc-o trees
	(XDC 2.X products).
    The compatibility with metaonly xdc-m packages (XDC 1.X products) is still maintained.

</p>
<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>

<p>Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product numbers 
and are intended to: 
</p>
<ol>

  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components, and 
  </li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to set end user 
  expectations. </li>
</ol>

<p>Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R - where: 

</p>
<ul>

  <li><b>M = Major</b>. A difference in M indicates a break in compatibility. 
  </li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>. A difference in S indicates source compability. That 
  is, the user's source doesn't require change, but <i>does</i> require 
  rebuilding. 
  </li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>. A difference in R indicates an introduction of new 
  features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not broken. If 
  libraries are provided by the package, an application must re-link with the 
  new libraries, but not rebuild from source. </li>
</ul>
