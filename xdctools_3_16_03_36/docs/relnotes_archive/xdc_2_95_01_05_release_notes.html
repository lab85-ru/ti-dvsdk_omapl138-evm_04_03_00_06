<h2><a name="General_Info">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>eXpress DSP Components (XDC) is a standard for reusable software
components, optimized for real-time embedded systems. XDC components
have hardware-neutral formal interfaces, are configurable offline to
optimize memory and performance, and support custom automation in the
development environment via a scripting language.</p>

<p>XDC 2.95.01 is a patch release.</p>

<p>This XDC release includes the following sets of packages: </p>

<ul>

  <li><b>XDC core (<tt>xdc.*</tt>)</b> - the <tt><b>xdc</b></tt> and
      <tt><b>xs</b></tt> command line utilities for building packages
	  and execting scripts, together with the packages that implement
	  XDC itself;</li>

  <li><b>User tools (<tt>xdc.tools.*</tt>)</b> - command-line
      and graphical utilities for working with packages and repositories;</li>

  <li><b>Targets (<tt>*.targets.*</tt>)</b> - definitions for using
      various TI and third-party compiler tool chains with XDC;</li>

  <li><b>Platforms (<tt>ti.platforms.*</tt>)</b> - definitions for
      linking and running code on various TI board-level hardware and
	  simulator products using XDC.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>

<p>Upgrading to XDC 2.95.01 is strongly
recommended for any user who is generating packages for distribution
using any earlier XDC 2.9X release.
For users who are using XDC only as package consumers, for example to
build executables, this upgrade is optional.</p>

<h2><a name="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>

<p>The following significant changes have been made since 2.94:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved compatibility for metaonly packages. Removed unnecessary
      dependencies on target-side XDC runtime, so that these packages
      can safely be used with different versions of
      xdc.runtime package.</li>
  <li>Source-incompatible changes to xdc.runtime package. Metaonly XDC
      modules are not affected. Non-metaonly modules require at least a
	  recompile.</li>
  <li>Significant functionality enhancements to the xdc.runtime
      package</li>
  <li>Improved support for ROM-able XDC target content</li>
  <li>Usability enhancements including additions to the repoman
      and cdoc tools, and fixes to previously release-noted installation
	  issues.
</ul>

<h3>2.95</h3>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Module Binary Contract</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added the builtin function Mod_Params_copy( Mod_Params* dst,
      const Mod_Params* src ) which is used to robustly copy
      Mod_Params struct in light of the new Assert check;
      Mod_Params_init() continues to behave as before.</li>
</ul> 

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Runtime</h4>
<ul>
  <li>set the compatibility key for xdc.runtime to [2,0,0,0]
      reflecting source-incompatible changes to this module. This
	  requires at least a recompile of any XDC module that
	  has target content. The changes to the package are detailed
	  in the remainder of this section.</li>
  <li>renamed the config Text.noLoadFlag (default false) to
      Text.isLoaded (default true).  the double-negative default was
      "not never" confusing</li>
  <li>changed the default of common$.namedModule to true</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in xdc.runtime.LoggerBuf in which dual-entry
      records were not being read/cleared correctly</li>
  <li>Added some xdoc to ITimestampProvider.</li>
  <li>Added a new System API: System_flush. This calls the
      ISystemSupport module that is plugged into System. The
      System_flush flushes pending io to stdout.</li>
  <li>System_abort and System_exit enter the system gate at the
      beginning of the functions.</li>
  <li>The internal implementation of SysMin was changed to use a
      template. This was done to completely remove HOSTwrite (or
      fwrite) when not needed.</li>
  <li>SysMin's flushFull implementation was changed slightly. It
      resets the index. So if you have flushFull set to true, it will
      flush when full, reset index and allow more data (which it will
      flush again when full).  This happens regardless of the wrap
      config parameter.</li>
  <li>added an assertion check in xdc.runtime.Core that validates
      when a Params struct explicitly passed to create/construct has
      been initialzed with a prior call to Params_init().
      [SDSCM00017539]</li>
  <li>added the interface xdc.runtime.ITimestampClient, which
      basically abstracts the contents of the well-known
      xdc.runtime.Timestamp module; the interface
      xdc.runtime.ITimestampProvider now inherits this interface.
      besides consolidating specs into one .xdc file, this pattern
      enables other modules (e.g., LoggerSys) to bind their
      respective proxies to an ITimestampClient -- either the
      well-known Timestamp module or else one of the
      ITimestampProviders.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the xdc.runtime.Core implementation of "create"
      in which a (smaller) interface Params struct passed to a proxy
      create() was not being correctly assigned to the underlying
      delegate's (larger) Params struct in light of the Assert check</li>
  <li>added a 'mask' field to Assert.Desc, analogous to a
      similarly-named field in Log.Desc, which further constrains
      runtime execution of assert statements involving the
      corresponding Assert_Id.  assuming a call to
      Diags_query(Diags_ASSERT) succeeds, a second Diags_query() call
      is made with any other bits in the mask (after clearing
      Diags_ASSERT).  in general, these masks can be re-assigned at
      .cfg time and even set to 0 (which will disable only this
      Assert_Id)</li>
  <li>added a Diags.INTERNAL level, with specific support for
      Assert_isTrue(expr,id) calls in which NULL is passed as the
      second arg.  in this case, the second Diags_query() call [see
      above] will implicitly test Diags_INTERNAL.  since Diags.ASSERT
      defaults to ALWAYS_ON, this enables "internal asserts" to be
      freely placed in time-critical code.</li>
  <li>added Diags.setMask$meta(Any pattern, Diags.Mask mask,
      Diags.Mode mode), which sets the appropriate common$.diags_???
      params for all modules whose fully-qualified name matches
      pattern.  the latter can be a string representing a
      fully-qualified name (with an optional trailing '%' for
      prefix-matching, not unlike in the runtime Diags_setMask
      function) or else a javascript RegExp</li>
  <li>changed the time values returned by xdc.runtime.TimestampNull
      to be ~0 rather than 0, avoiding confusion with
      ITimestampProvider modules that may initially return 0 (e.g.,
      using an underlying Timer before interrupts are enabled).
      Log_print() will continue to suppress output of timestamps when
      this (new) sentinel value is present</li>
  <li>updates to xdc.runtime.SysMin to avoid direct calls to
      'write/HOSTwrite'; putting SysMin in ROM also no longer
      requires .cio in the ROM linker map</li>
  <li>fixed missing va_end in xdc.runtime.Text</li>
  <li>added documentation to Assert.xdc, Diags.xdc, and Log.xdc.</li>
  <li>internal changes in the implementation of ModA_construct(),
      enabling run-time checking of the size of client-supplied
      ModA_Struct against the actual ModA_Object size in the
      underlying implementation; this check enables module producers
      to grow/shrink the Instance_State struct, so long as it is not
      larger than the ModA_Struct used by clients calling
      ModA_construct(); more important, clients calling
      ModA_construct() do *not* have to be recompiled so long as this
      constraint holds.</li>
  <li>refactored xdc.runtime.Memory to use an internal proxy in lieu
      of making abstract function calls; no client impact</li>
  <li>internal changes in the implementation of per-module gate
      support, using an implicitly spec'd proxy named
      Module_GateProxy in lieu of the special @System functions
      defined today in xdc.runtime.IModule.  no client impact</li>
  <li>the default Heap module used by xdc.runtime.Memory, if not
      default heap iinstance is provided, is *always*
      xdc.runtime.HeapStd; use of xdc.runtime.HeapMin must now be
      explicit</li>
  <li>System_abort() takes a string. Deleted System_fail();
      System.maxExitHandlers defaults to 8</li>
  <li>Folded in SysMin review changes. New config parameters for
      ISystemSupport interface functions. When set these functions
      will override the SysMin implementations. Updated SysMin ROM
      workaround to make output an internal function so that it's in
      the spec file. Eliminated flushFull config parameter. SysMin
      will use the System gate.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in LoggerBuf_getNextEntry(). Check return from
      System_atexit().</li>
  <li>If Memory.defaultHeapInstance is null, don't create a default
      heap.</li>
  <li>Fixed Startup.reset for ROM. This involved changes to Startup
      module as well as boot code for all targets (now call reset__I
      instead of reset__E).</li>
  <li>Added an EXTERN_FUNC pragma to the generated Startup_reset
      function so that it isn't lost in RAM assemblies, since it is
      later referenced by the boot code in the final link.</li>
  <li>System will add System_rtsExit() to list of rts exit handlers
      by calling atexit() at Startup. System_rtsExit() will call all
      System exit handlers and call the SupportProxy's exit function.</li>
  <li>New System.atexitMeta to help ass System exit handlers statically.</li>
  <li>System_exit() will call exit(). System_abort() will call abort.</li>
  <li>SysMin and SysStd no longer call rts functions exit() and
      abort().</li>
  <li>LoggerBuf uses System.atexitMeta to plug flush function</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in Logger_getNextEntry function</li>
  <li>Turned on documentation for ILogger.xdc, LoggerBuf.xdc, and
      LoggerSys.xdc. Documentation still in progress.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in System/SysMin in which System_abort() calls were
      not flushing accumulated output; System_abort( String msg ) now
      writes the msg using SupportProxy_putch(), calls
      SupportProxy_flush(), calls SupportProxy_abort(msg), and then
      abort()</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in calls to Error_raise from legacy .c files caused
      a compiler error; indirectly, this bug prevented use of
      internal assert statements as well</li>
  <li>as a rule, invocation of proxy functions on the target should
      be limited to the module declaring the proxy; the only "public"
      aspect of proxy is its binding in the .cfg domain.  to comply,
      the implementation of Gate_enterSystem() has been altered to no
      longer "reach into" the System module and invoke its GateProxy.
      this problem became apparent when RAM-based modules attempt to
      "reach into" ROM-based modules and invoke their proxies.
      if one module requires run-time access to another's proxy, the
      former should declare a (internal) proxy of its own and simply
      bind it accordingly.  this approach has *no* impact of
      target-side performance</li>
  <li>More documentation updates to Assert and Diags modules.
      Added xdoc for Defaults module.</li>
</ul>		

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Targets</h4>
<ul>
  <li>fixed rts6000 boot file (SDSCM16337)</li>
  <li>added empty section .sysmem to the boot files for C55 targets;
      this section prevents warnings from the linker when there is
      no input section .sysmem;  memory.obj brings that input section
      into the executable, but if no one is using malloc or SysStd is
      not used, memory.obj does not get linked in</li>
  <li>added new platform package ti.platforms.sim430xx, new runtime
      package ti.targets.rts430 and a new catalog package
      ti.catalog.c430 to support the MSP430 target</li>
  <li>moved the fix for .sysmem warning on C55 targets from boot files
      to Program.xdt. The previous fix in boot files, where .sysmem
      section was created would cause linker to create a .sysmem
      output section of size 0x1000 even if the option '-heap 0x0'
      was passed to the linker. Now, Program.xdt examines
      Program.heap and only if it's not 0, a dummy variable is placed
      in .sysmem</li>
  <li>ti/targets/linkcmd.xdt and linker command files in examples are
      now using Program.getSectMap() function</li>
  <li>Removed argsize directive from linkcmd.xdt for ROM assemblies.
      This prevents the c_arg symbol from being created in the ROM
      image.</li>
  <li>Revert Arm compiler back to 4.1.4</li>
  <li>Use -op2 for ARM whole_program build</li>
  <li>fixed bugs in ti.targets linkcmd.xdt; loadSegment was referenced without
      checking if it's defined</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Platforms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added TNETV2685 (Kailash) catalog files</li>
  <li>added additional XDOC for platform instances and predefined
      macros</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Configuration</h4>
<ul>
  <li>fixed a problem in sync'ing the value of Program.system with
      System.SupportProxy, in the event that the latter is explictly
      assigned.  if Program.system is undefined, the value of
      System.SupportProxy (default SysMin) is pushed into
      Program.system; otherwise, the reverse assignment occurs.
      assigning *both* Program.system and SystemSupportProxy is not
      recommended.  in general, use of Program.system should be
      strongly discouraged going forward and may even generate
      warnings in the future.  this enables xdc.runtime.System to be
      "used" and its proxy bound no differently than any other module</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in which ModA_Handle_label__S was not being
      retained in partial-links</li>
  <li>Program.getSectMap is added to Progam. It returns the current
      section map based on the same sequence of step that the linker
      command file template is making when creating the final section
      map. In the next tree, the template should be changed to use
      the new function. (SDSCM00015209)</li>
  <li>added cfgHome attr to xdc.bld.Executable.Attrs; this allows
      one to specify the package that is bound to $homepkg in the
      configuration model.</li>
  <li>refactored the back-end of the .cfg model to ensure the
      xdc.runtime package is correctly finalized; this corrects a
      problem in which "early" calls to
      xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.System') were leading to unbound
      proxies.</li>
  <li>removed Program.memory; config scripts should instead directly
      reference xdc.runtime.Memory; updated all examples</li>
  <li>removed Program.common$Defaults; config scripts should instead
      configure the new xdc.runtime.Defaults module through the
      standard 'common$' metaonly struct, which otherwise plays the
      same role; updated all examples</li>
  <li>deprecated assignments to Program.system, with a warning now
      being output.  depending upon the presence of "used" target
      modules, the back-end of .cfg will conditionally bring-in the
      xdc.runtime.package; assignment of 'null' to Program.system is
      no longer necessary for pure legacy programs; and as is the
      case already, Program.system cannot be 'null' if target modules
      are present.  in cases where legacy code calls (say)
      System_printf -- and no other modules are otherwise included --
      an explict call to xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.System') is in
      order.  in general, this is the recommend pattern -- #include
      a module, xdc.useModule a module.  Assigning the
      System.SupportProxy (default, xdc.runtime.SysMin) allows
      selection of alternative ISystemSupport modules (e.g.,
      xdc.runtime.SysStd).  updated all examples.</li>
  <li>Program.symbol entries are now declared in the same generated
      .h file including the Program.global entries; in cases where a
      symbol is equated to a statically-created instance, the
      declaration is of the form extern pkg_ModA_Object symName.
      in general, client programs will reference the value of the
      symbol through a '&symName' expression</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Core</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Added use of radix to XVal.Number.</li>
  <li>fixed SDSCM00015806, in which use of '()' and '(Void)' in
      function-pointer declarators were yielding incompatible
      signatures</li>
  <li>fixed a problem in the generation of __E_D helper-functions
      used to support per-instance proxy functions that surfaced in
      the ROM flow</li>
  <li>fixed SDSCM00015016:  all "interface objects" are now sealed in
      the meta-domain, preventing any changes to module-wide configs
      spec'd in this interface.
      Note: the parameter $used for interfaces is left unsealed, so
      xdc.useModule() can have an interface as a parameter. this is
      a temporary solution until we find out how should users get
      handles to interfaces</li>
  <li>the file package/cfg/*.rta.xml is now being generated for all
      executable programs; it contains sufficient info to support a
      standalone decoder for binary Log.EventRec structs.
      the package xdc/rta contains will shortly contain a java-based
      decoder that is driven by the info in this .xml file.  details
      of associating this .xml file with the executable image are TBD.</li>
  <li>__ASM__ string in executables now contains absolute path to
      assembly</li>
  <li>changed the implementation of proxy-checking so that calls to
      xdc.useModule() contained in module$use functions do not
      immediately act upon the used module's proxies</li>
  <li>refactored much the close() function in xdc/runtime/package.xs
      into the module$use() function in xdc/runtime/System.xs.</li>
  <li>removed the special internal function finalize() in
      xdc/cfg/package.xs</li>
  <li>generalized the implementation of proxy instances, such that a
      collection of modules with proxies inheriting a common
      interface can exchange instances of their respective proxies
      more naturally.  in effect, all proxy instance handles are
      typedef'd as abstract instance handles from the inherited
      interface.  while some static type-safety has been sacrified at
      the C compiler level, the use of config-time validation (plus
      run-time asserts, if needed) make up the balance.  run-time
      performance is unchanged, and no source code changes are needed
      in the current code base.  this feature is motivated by more
      "advanced" designs involving collections of abstract
      interfaces, where each interface may itself spec several
      abstract proxies.</li>
  <li>Added checks to xdc.services.global.Path.setPath() to catch
      XDCPATH syntax errors early and report a specific error message.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the typedef of proxy-module instance handles
      that surfaced when the proxy inherited an interface in a
      different package</li>
  <li>updated the generation of __E/__F stubs for vargs functions to
      now call va_end(), suppressing a warning from code checkers
      like coverity</li>
  <li>In tconf.ksh and xs.ksh, exec'd to the native executable
      instead of forking to it. Eliminates some corner cases that
      occur when running XDC scripts that fork background threads.</li>
  <li>In xdc.services.spec, generated Javadoc files during
      package release.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in .sch file generation in which reference to
      'xdc.rov.support' datatypes were being incorrectly named</li>
  <li>Fixed null-pointer exception in spec.BrowserSession.loadUnit</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in which packages containing modules whose names
      conflict with IPackage functions (e.g., a module named 'close')
      were yielding errors in the generated .sch file.  while this
      fix actually allows modules named 'close', this practice is
      highly discouraged.  to maintain backward-compatibility, this
      fix will trigger automatic re-generation of older .sch files
      upon loading their respective packages</li>
  <li>xdc.bin was build with compatibility checking disabled, so that
      we can build xdc.bin with xdc.runtime [2,0,0,0];  the package
      being an issue was xdc.host.services.lib from xdcutils tree,
      which was built with xdc.runtime [1,0,0,0];  this is a cycle to
      be resolved</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in xe where old #defines were not replaced with
      xdc_target__os #defines</li>
</ul>

  <li>added the 'romPatchTable' config (default false) to common$;
      this param is only meaningful when configuring ROM assemblies.
      if true, all calls to the current module *from within the ROM*
      will be vectored through a data-resident patch-table.
      if false, calls to this module originating in the ROM are
      executed through the normal runtime, enabling autoinlining with
      WPO.</li>
  <li>Program.importRomAsm() now executes the original .cfg script
      associated with the ROM assembly.  all modules in the ROM
      assembly are also finalized through a call to module$use().</li>
  <li>added Program.freezeRomConfig(), used in .cfg scripts or .xs
      files executed during a ROM assembly to designate a particular
      module-wide config to be bound ("frozen") in the ROM image.
      as a side effect of this call, the designate config is sealed
      to prevent further (accidental) modification.  by default,
      static initialization of *all* configs are deferred to the
      final assembly.  as a consequence, ROM functions may incur
      inefficiencies when accessing module-wide configs in general.</li>
  <li>changed Program.freezeRomConfig() to only seal configs in the
      final assembly, and only after all module$use() functions for
      the original ROM modules have been called.  this accommondates
      potentially "out-of-order" closings due to proxy-induced
      config-time cycles amongst packages</li>
  <li>further ROM optimizations, including the freezing of some
      system config params as well as embedded object offsets</li>
  <li>all "system functions" spec'd in xdc.runtime.IModule are now
      ROM-able, reducing both time and space overhead; the functions
      are no longer called via a patch-table</li>
  <li>added Program.patchRom( modName, fxnName, symbol ) used for
      "emergency" patches to suitably-configured modules
      (patchTable == true) in final assemblies</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the ROM flow in which a ROM'd module and a RAM'd
      module inheriting from a common interface were resulting in
      multiple definitions of the special interface BASE__C symbols</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuro Build Tool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Changed configuro to allow better use of config.bld.
      Added "--cb" option to explicitly
      search for config.bld along the package path. Config.bld is
      now only included when it is asked for, either with --cb or
      the existing -b flag.</li>
  <li>Config.bld will be used if either
      -b or --cb flags are thrown. -b takes precedence,
      specifying the location of config.bld exactly.</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Repoman Repository Management Tool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sort file names returned from Java.io.File.listFiles()</li>
  <li>Added File, Edit and Help menus & Help->About box</li>
  <li>"fixed" repoman to not scan the current working directory
      for packages; it now only scans the package path.</li>
  <li>extract/copy repositories from compressed and installed bundles</li>
  <li>added -o and -i args to save repository info and restore a repository</li>
  <li>File->Save and File->Open to save and restore current state</li>
  <li>-recognize products as packages when looking for bundles</li>
  <li>-drag n drop crash bug when re-ordering repositories in rh pane
      -gray text for read-only repositories in rh pane</li>
  <li>-Modified text in tooltips, dialog titles,
      menus, etc. to help make usage less confusing
      -Added tooltips over tree titles that explains
      what the tree does
      -Added context menus on Available Packages tree
      parent nodes
      -Make sure tooltips stay inside screen
      boundaries
      -Make tooltip disappear when dragging a package
      to a repository</li>
  <li>new .rmn file format
      --rrestore & --rrcreate for restoring/creating
      repositories from file saved with -outfile</li>
  <li>new processing of .rmn files on File->Open</li>
</ul>
		
<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Xdoc / Cdoc Package Documentation Tool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In xdc.tools.cdoc, added @fn, @typedef, @struct, and @enum
      tags, modeled after Doxygen's tags of the same name. Using
      these tags in a module's or interface's XDOC lets you add
      comments to any declaration of the module, even generated ones.
      Similarly the existing tag @param can be used to document
      generated function parameters such as an instance handle or
      error block.</li>
  <li>cleaned up names of generated C function
      parameters. Fixed bug in generation of links for @link'd files.</li>
  <li>Added new command-line parameters	to open
      docs pages on startup. Declaration can be listed on the command
      line using the same syntax as the {@link} tag.</li>
  <li>updated index tree to show red-world and
      blue-world units and functions. Generated the index tree
      lazily,	to minimize the delay in opening the tool. Fixed bug in
      which @link targets were not correctly validated against the
      known XDC declarations.</li>
  <li>fixed bug in using from command line.</li>
  <li>presented a simple XDC Script view. This filters
      out all target-only content, and presets the metaonly and mixed
      target/meta content using the XDC spec syntax. Added XDC Script
      declarations for create(), construct(), and Params{}.</li>
  <li>in xdc.tools.idl.Node, added ability to prune the node tree
      while constructing from the spec, to improve cdoc speed and
	  memory usage.</li>
  <li>updated the stylesheet to reduce clutter in
      the generated documentation. Shortened all declarations in the
      unit summary block to one line each. Reordered to put functions
      first. In the details sections, removed comments from prototype
      and moved them into PARAMETERS, FIELDS and VALUES sections as
      in xdoc.</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Path Tool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>_buildRepArray: build array in path order</li>
  <li>update xdcpkg call path for engineering tree</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuration Viewer Tool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added an experimental xdc.tools.objviewer.sg which is
      package configuration browser.
      usage: xs xdc.tools.objviewer.sg
      [-e executableName] [-p path] packagename</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Other Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In xdc.tools.mkpkg, added ability to copy a file or
      directory without template expansion. Enabled by adding
      "@verbatim" to the file's line in the mkpkg.xdt file.
      Updated package docs.</li>
  <li>Added tests to xdc.tools.sg.swt_linux package to help diagnose
      setup of Mozilla, required to use xdc.tools.cdoc.sg
      documentation browser on Linux. Checks the environment
      variables Mozilla requires, and prints warning text if not
      correct.</li>
  <li>In xdc.tools.Cmdr, fixed a couple of minor documentation errors</li>
  <li>added a ResourceBundle module to xdc.tools. ResourceBundle
      provides access to localized properties files within
      packages. See the xdoc.</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>RTSC Object Viewer</h4>
<ul>
  <li>fixed an ROV bug in which the xdc.runtime package was being
      loaded *before* xdc.om.$name was defined</li>
  <li>Added Model_reset() and Program.resetMods() to allow resetting
      of data structures read from target at ROV time.</li>
  <li>Added ROV views to several modules in xdc.runtime package</li>
</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
  <li>added the example basic.absproxy to illustrate a use-case of
      proxy declarations in interfaces which in turn are referenced
      as types in the same abstract spec.  quite advanced, this is
      actually a "solution" to a well-known type-covariance problem.
      a first practical application of this pattern will be in
      specifying signatures of process functions in abstract
      codecs/algorithms that do *not* involve use of void* as a
      unifying type.</li>
  <li>fixed basic.scripts example to run the chack.xs script
      that displays a package's dependencies</li>
  <li>In examples/configuro/plat_inst, updated to use platform-j15
      tree because of package incompatibility.</li>
  <li>Aligned examples with System changes</li>
  <li>added comments to local.targets example</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Compatibility">Upgrade and Compatibility Information</a></h2>

<ul>

  <li><b><tt>xdc.runtime</tt></b> - This package is <font color="red">incompatible</font> with the 
  previous release. (Compatibility key: 1,0,0,0 -&gt; <font color="red"><b>2</b></font>,0,0,0) 
  </li>
</ul>


<p><b>Warning:</b> Beginning with XDC 2.95, XDC modules with target content (i.e. non-
    meta-only) are incompatible with non-metaonly modules from XDC 2.94 and earlier.
	Metaonly modules are not affected. Non-metaonly modules require at least a recompile.</li>
</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Beginning with xdc-o02, internal C files generated when
    building package schemas are
    named package_&lt;package name&gt;.c instead of &lt;package_name&gt;.c.
    This may introduce incompatibilities with older xdc-n and xdc-o trees
	(XDC 2.X products).
    The compatibility with metaonly xdc-m packages (XDC 1.X products) is still maintained.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>

<p>Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product numbers 
and are intended to: 
</p>
<ol>

  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components, and 
  </li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to set end user 
  expectations. </li>
</ol>

<p>Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R - where: 

</p>
<ul>

  <li><b>M = Major</b>. A difference in M indicates a break in compatibility. 
  </li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>. A difference in S indicates source compability. That 
  is, the user's source doesn't require change, but <i>does</i> require 
  rebuilding. 
  </li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>. A difference in R indicates an introduction of new 
  features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not broken. If 
  libraries are provided by the package, an application must re-link with the 
  new libraries, but not rebuild from source. </li>
</ul>
