<div class="memitem">
<h3>3.00.00.05 (This Release)</h3>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Runtime</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Reworked the implementation of xdc.runtime.Text to avoid
recursion when traversing ropes, which occured when printing
fully-qualified module names as well as when matching module-name
patterns through Diags_setMask(). Besides minimizing runtime stack
usage and (theoretically) enabling static analysis of worse-case stack
depth, this change also make better use of the internal rope
representation to capture redundency in package-prefixes of module
names; runtime code size, however, is roughly the same as before.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug in xdc.runtime.Error that prevented calls to
Error_raise in legacy .c files. Like other diags, the controlling
module for legacy .c files automatically becomes xdc.runtime.Main</li>

  <li>Error_raise() is now robust against "nested errors" in
which the raiseHook() itself leads to a call to Error_raise(); in this
case, Error_raise terminates abruptly by calling System_abort() with a
special message</li>

  <li>Removed error id's E_{device,value} from xdc.runtime.Error,
leaving only E_{generic,memory}. These former error id's are no longer
used by anyone (and in fact have an unsupported '%$R' format specifier
in their msg string, proving further that no one is really using them);
the format string in the remaining E_generic has also been changed to
use '%s'. Since these have been on the "to-be-removed" list for
sometime, no change in xdc.runtime MSRP will occur.</li>

  <li>Moved the handling of the abort string to the proxys. The
ISystemSupport modules now flush on abort (SysMin's can be disabled via
the flushAtExit config parameter). Create Memory.defaultHeapInstance if
it is null or undefined.</li>

  <li>Documentation updates to modules Assert, Diags, Error, Log,
and LoggerBuf in the xdc.runtime package.</li>

  <li>Renamed Diags.setMask$meta() to Diags.setMaskMeta()</li>

  <li>added XDOC for *Timestamp* modules and interface</li>

  <li>Made HeapStd thread-safe. Checking align parameter in
HeapStd_alloc now. It fails if the value is larger than the supported
size of malloc.</li>

  <li>In SysMin and SysStd, allowed for NULL string parameter to
abort().</li>

  <li>Added Timestamp proxy config to LoggerBuf; to match
LoggerSys</li>

  <li>In Text, fixed multiple buffer overrun bugs and premature
truncation of output to buffer. pkgGroup regular expression fixed to
properly match only xdc.runtime packages</li>

  <li>Demoted the typedef 'xdc.runtime.SysMin.OutputFunc' to
internal, since this was never intended to be client-visible</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Targets</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Added a missing "." to some references to 'bss' in
ti/targets/linkcmd.xdt</li>

  <li>Added reset and exit function hooks to rts470/boot.asm</li>

  <li>Added '--recursion_limit=20' to the arm profile
'whole_program'</li>

  <li>Enabled sdkPath in microsoft.targets.Win32 to accept
absolute paths (SDSCM00016858)</li>

  <li>Moved dependency flags into cc.cmd for MVArm9 target</li>

  <li>Boot code in rts5500 was invalid for small data model,
could corrupt top seven bits of XAR6 register</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Platforms</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Platform tests are separated into their own packages, so
that loading a platform does not create a dependency on the package
xdc.runtime</li>

  <li>added evm6452 and evmTNETV2685</li>

  <li>clock rate on sdp3430 changed to 312.4</li>

  <li>updated ti.platforms.generic XDOC to explain how to use
this platform to "create" a usable platform</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>XDC Core</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Moved std.h out of the xdc.runtime package, and into the
xdc package; std.h also no longer directly #includes <xdc>. this
enables legacy .c files that #include <xdc> to no longer have a
needless dependency on the xdc.runtime package</xdc></xdc></li>

  <li>Altered the generation of package/package.c to avoid
unconditional #includes of xdc.runtime headers; these are only included
if the package contains target modules. This change also helps reduce
bogus dependencies on the xdc.runtime package, not only in packages
that create legacy libraries but even legacy programs</li>

  <li>Relaxed a limitation in which spec'd consts associated with
a (target) module were only available in the .cfg model; values of
consts can now be retrieved in *any* xs context. Access to spec'd
configs, on the other hand, are still contrained to the .cfg model</li>

  <li>Program.system is of type 'Any' to avoid dependency on
xdc.runtime in the cases when there are no target modules in a program;
if Program.system is needed and a module is assigned to it, the module
must inherit ISystemSupport</li>

  <li>Added three special marker files to the package/ subdir
whose names include the internal "version" of the green/red/blue worlds
respectively; these files will enable future XDCTOOLS to re-generate
internal files (e.g., *.ccs/*.sch/package.c files) on a more
fine-grained basis. Existing packages (which, of course, don't already
have these files) can be easily discerned by future XDCTOOLS, hence
there is no compatibility issues here</li>

  <li>Removed dependency on libstdc++ when building XDC tools for
Linux and Solaris</li>

  <li>Fixed a warning from Microsoft compilers pertaining to the
internal function xdc_runtime_Text_visitRope by simplifying the
declaration of its signature thru 'Fxn' and using some casts within
Text.c.</li>

  <li>Removed spurious references to xdc.runtime from generated
package.c files, as well as further decoupled xdc.cfg from xdc.runtime.</li>

  <li>package/build.cfg is added to the standard release; without
that file, on-line rebuilding of schemas does not recreate correctly
the list of libraries in pkg.build.libraries</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug in which units named in package.xdc that do not
exist (e.g., no .xdc file) were causing a fatal java exception. a more
appropriate error message is now emitted.</li>

  <li>Enabled a finer-grained mechanism for on-the-fly
regeneration of selected package files. Using the recently added
package/.vers_{rgb}<n> files, we can independently regenerate
(green) .css files, (red) .sch files, and (blue) package.c files if
needed. This mechanism is critical to maintaining (full-)compability in
the face of changes to these internal files; this mechanism also
comprehends older packages in a backward-compatible manner. As part of
this change, the .ccs file no longer carries a <n> suffix.</n></n></li>

  <li>Added a distinguished package named 'xdc.corevers', whose
MSRP basically reflects the overall compatibility of the core packages
in this version of the XDCTOOLS with others before/after it. All
released packages will depended implicitly on this 'xdc.corevers',
though this special package has no content. There is also no formal
relationship between this package's MSRP and the "external version" of
the XDCTOOLS (e.g., 3.1.12). By convention, the MSRP of this package
will change whenever a new release (major, minor, patch) of XDCTOOLS
occurs, and will reflect the compatibility constraints (full vs
backward vs source vs none) accordingly.</li>

  <li>Fixed the bug in schema regeneration code when there are
libraries in the package; the libraries are listed in
package/build.cfg, but that file was not a part of a standard release,
so during regeneration that file would not be found and the list of
libraries would be empty; in xdc-p06 we added build.cfg to the standard
release, but when older packages are consumed, we need to recreate
build.cfg on the fly; it is done by reading the list of libraries from
package.bld.xml</li>

  <li>Updated documentation for getLibs in xdc.IPackage</li>

  <li>Changed xdc.services.spec.ParserSession System.exit() into
Java exceptions. The console output on some parser errors has changed,
with an additional line following the main error message: "error:
compilation failed: parser failed"</li>

  <li>EXPERIMENTAL ADDITION -- first implementation of the @Annex(<n>)
attribute, which can be applied to public target configs and functions
in modules. configs/fxns annotated in this way are generated *after*
all other decls, enabling addition of configs/fxns while maintaining
binary backwards-compatibility when structs are used in the underlying
implementation. the integer parameter <n> must be positive to
have any effect. as a rule, all decls are output in the same order as
input, suggesting that simply re-ordering a module's decls can
potentially break backwards-compatibility in some cases</n></n></li>

  <li>EXPERIMENTAL ADDITION -- first implementation of the
@NoRuntime attribute, used in target modules wishing to opt-out of any
xdc.runtime support. this enables target modules with const/type/extern
declarations to have no implicit dependencies on the xdc.runtime
package. such modules do *not* implicitly inherit xdc.runtime.IModule,
and hence have no common$ metaonly config.</li>

  <li>EXPERIMENTAL ADDITION -- 'extern' declarations (fxns or
vars) appearing in .xdc files are no longer required to have an
identifier initializer. if absent, the extern 'pkg.Mod.ext' is
basically an alias for the C symbol 'pkg_Mod_ext'. this offers module
producers a simpler alternative to @DirectCall, in that it not only
looks more "natural" in the .xdc file but also does not introduce a
symbol with the __E suffix in the linkmap. this feature melds well with
the new @NoRuntime attribute, and provides a potentially "lower-risk"
path for migrating legacy content</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuro Build Tool</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Explicitly set homepkg to the configuration package.
Prevents problems with homepkg when the user's config script is not
itself in a package. Removed the previous workaround to this problem,
which was to create a stub for the user's config script in the
generated package. The generated package.bld script now points directly
to the user's .cfg file.</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Repoman Repository Management Tool</h4>

<ul>

  <li>For --rrestore and --rcreate options, do not restore/create
repository unless the operatins can be completed successfully.</li>

  <li>Added RepoRestore.xs, a dialog that is invoked upon opening
a .rmn file.</li>

  <li>Removed automatic compatiblity checking from Package Path
tree in xdc.tools.repoman.sg and added toolbar button that invokes a
compatibility check when pressed</li>

  <li>Implemented lazy tree expansion for Available Packages tree
and Package Path tree</li>

  <li>Modified command line for repo restore and repo create.</li>

  <li>Fixed/updated documentation in Main.xdc and package.xdc for
better cdoc viewing.</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Xdoc / Cdoc Package Documentation Tool</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Added checks for the case when referred-to packages are not
available on the package path. If a packaged neede for documentation
(e.g. it defines an interface that a module in another package
implements) is not available, and not able to be recovered from private
information in the dependent package, cdoc cannot show the package docs
and instead shows a grey icon in the index. This use case is unique to
cdoc and does not affect configuration. The full workaround is for the
user to make the needed packages available on the package path.</li>

  <li>Updated command line usage message. Modified cdoc to use
xdc.tools.ICmd to decode command line.</li>

  <li>Optimized program startup time. On startup the package path
is inventoried, but little else. The index view is filled on demand.
Added progress info in the status bar.</li>

  <li>Modified to use the doxygen stylesheet, which displays the
generated output in a more compact format. Made generated abstract type
converters @_nodoc to reduce clutter. These can still be viewed via the
view @_nodoc button.</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Path Tool</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Check package path packages for shadow files and flag them
when found</li>

  <li>Fixed/updated documentation in Main.xdc and package.xdc for
better cdoc viewing.</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Configuration Viewer Tool</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Added right-click menu to bring up cdoc browser of any
package visible in the configuration.</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Other Tools</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Enhanced xdc.tools.Cmdr to allow non-Posix syntax for
command-line options, for use in existing tools without breaking option
compatibility. The @CommandOption() attribute now allows the '-' or
'--' flag prefix to optionally be included in the attribute text, so
that '-' can be used with long option names.</li>

  <li>Fixed xdc.tools.sg.swt_linux to not warn when used to
simply determine schema dependencies</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Added examples/basic/absconst, both to illustrate the
ability to define "abstract" constants in either interfaces or modules,
as well as the ability of the latter to override abstract constant
specs in the former. this example also includes a test script that
accesses various constants outside of the .cfg model</li>

  <li>Added /basic/vers/rtos/test to test ability to access
config parames *outside* config model</li>

  <li>In etrain/filters examples Fir.c, made align parameter for
history alloc() work on targets with MAU sizes other than eight bits.</li>

  <li>In basic.instname, added test of label output to a buffer</li>

  <li>In basic.logging, added ability to easily switch between
LoggerBuf and LoggerSys (to see "same" output).</li>

</ul>

<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h4>Installer</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Added ability to install XDC tools to a shared network
drive, without installing Windows registry entries</li>

  <li>Added ability to choose which components of XDC tools to
install</li>

  <li>Bug fix to InstallJammer when nested inside another product
installer</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Compatibility">Upgrade and
Compatibility Information</a></h2>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Beginning with XDC 2.95, XDC
modules with target content (i.e. non-meta-only) are incompatible with
non-metaonly modules from XDC 2.94 and earlier. Metaonly modules are
not affected. Non-metaonly modules require at least a recompile.
</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Beginning with xdc-o02, internal C
files generated when building package schemas are named
package_&lt;package name&gt;.c instead of
&lt;package_name&gt;.c. This may introduce incompatibilities
with older xdc-n and xdc-o trees (XDC 2.X products). The compatibility
with metaonly xdc-m packages (XDC 1.X products) is still maintained.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>

<p>Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing
product
numbers and are intended to: </p>

<ol>

  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between
components, and </li>

  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases
to set end user expectations. </li>

</ol>

<p>Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers -
M,S,R - where: </p>

<ul>

  <li><b>M = Major</b>. A difference in M indicates a

  <li><b>S = Source</b>. A difference in S indicates
source compability. That is, the user's source doesn't require change,
but <i>does</i> require rebuilding. </li>

  <li><b>R = Radix</b>. A difference in R indicates
an introduction of new features, but compatibility with previous
interfaces has not broken. If libraries are provided by the package, an
application must re-link with the new libraries, but not rebuild from
source. </li>
