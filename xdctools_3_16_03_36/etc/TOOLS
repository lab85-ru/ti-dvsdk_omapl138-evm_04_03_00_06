# ======== TOOLS ========
#
#  This file defines macros that are used to locate the various 
#  tools used for XDC builds.  The following macros may be defined:
#
#    JRE        - location of the Java runtime directory.  The default 
#                 value is $(XDCROOT)/jre.
#
#    CLASSPATH  - the classpath used when running the XDC tools.  The 
#                 default is "<dir>/iliad.jar;<dir>/antlr.jar;<dir>/js.jar",
#                 where <dir> is the directory containing iliad.jar.
#
#    JDK        - location of a Java Developer's Kit.  There is no default.
#                 This value is only used when building packages that 
#                 contain Java code.
