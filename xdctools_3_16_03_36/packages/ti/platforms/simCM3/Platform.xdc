 *  ======== Platform ========
 *  Simulation-based Platform support for TI Cortex M3 platforms
 *
 *  This module implements xdc.platform.IPlatform and defines configuration
 *  parameters that correspond to this platform's Cpu's, Board's, etc.
 *
 *  The configuration parameters are initialized in this package's
 *  configuration script (package.cfg) and "bound" to the TCOM object
 *  model.  Once they are part of the model, these parameters are
 *  queried by a program's configuration script.
 *
 *  This particular platform has a single Cpu, and therefore, only
 *  declares a single CPU configuration object.  Multi-CPU platforms
 *  would declare multiple Cpu configuration parameters (one per
 *  platform CPU).
