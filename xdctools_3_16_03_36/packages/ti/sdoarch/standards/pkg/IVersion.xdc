 *  ======== IVersion ========
 *  Standard package version number interface
 *
 *  This interface is part of the SDO Package Standard.  Each conformant
 *  package that supplies a version number contains a module named
 *  `Version` that implements this interface.  In other words,
 *  @p(blist)
 *      - the package's `package.xdc` file declares `Version` as one of it's
 *        modules
 *      - the package contains a spec for the `Version` module (named
 *        `Version.xdc`) and a header generated from this spec (named
 *        `Version.h`)
 *      - the `Version.xdc` file may optionally be generated from the
 *        `ti/sdoarch/standards/pkg/Version.xdt` template when the package's
 *        build script runs.
 *  @p
 *
 *  This interface defines a set of values that are used to 
 *  @p(nlist)
 *      - informally communicate the "degree" of change between successive
 *        releases of a package,
 *      - provide a "key" that enables the producer to unambigeously identify
 *        the sources (and tools) used to produce the package, and
 *      - enable consumers to easily communicate to producers the version(s)
 *        of the package(s) they are using.

     *  this confusion, it is common practice to adopt a fixed minimum field
     *  width that's when printing version dimensions (other than MAJOR);
     *  e.g., rather than printing "6.1", if WIDTH == 2 then the version would
     *  be displayed as "6.01".
