      <P><I>Perhaps no technology company outside of IBM has been able to keep 
      on top of the industry as much as Microsoft. What's more, Bill Gates &amp;

      being knocked off by disruptive technologies. </P>
      <P>Critics often argue that Microsoft can't innovate its way out of a

      company from Harvard Business School professors <B>Marco Iansiti</B> and

      <P><B>Iansiti and MacCormack:</B> The essence of our argument is that the 
      key to Microsoft's success is the way it manages its intellectual 
      property. By this we don't just mean patents, but the broad base of 
      knowledge that the company has built over time, which is largely embedded 
      in its software code libraries. This base is critical to internal 
      innovation, as it makes product development more efficient and powerful. 
      Additionally, it spawns external innovation, in Microsoft's large 
      community of partners, which now numbers almost 40,000 firms.</P>
      <P>To understand the way Microsoft manages IP, you have to go back to the 
      roots of the company. Back in the late 1970s, its first products were 
      aimed at helping other programmers develop applications for the computing 
      hardware of the day. It focused on developing programming 
      <I>platforms,</I> in contrast to most other firms who focused on 
      stand-alone applications. It was an approach that permeated both their 
      tools business—the software they provided to other programmers for 
      developing applications; and the operating system business—the software 
      upon which these applications would run.</P>

      <P>It was during these early days that Microsoft began to invest in 
      creating libraries of programming "components": building blocks of 
      intellectual property that could be used to develop different software 
      applications. The original impetus was the need to provide programmers 
      with pre-defined interfaces through which they could access commonly used 
      functions and features. Why reinvent the wheel if someone else had already 
      worked out what it should look like? In essence, Microsoft began codifying 
      knowledge and embedding it in a form that could be leveraged, both by 
      itself and others. But it got to decide which components to "expose," and 
      which to keep hidden, providing a mechanism through which its core 
      intellectual property could be protected.</P>
      <P>As the company expanded, Microsoft formalized this component framework 
      and developed a "programming model" to go along with it—in essence, 
      defining the way that applications should interact with its preexisting 
      software components. It extended the model to its application business, 
      sharing increasing amounts of code between products like Word and Excel. 
      Over time, as more and more partners signed up to use the model, 
      developing applications for Microsoft's operating systems and using 
      Microsoft's tools in the process, the power of the platform became 
      evident. It was a win-win relationship—the community of development 
      partners received benefits in terms of enhanced productivity, while 
      Microsoft's position was strengthened through the deployment of products 
      that were complementary to its own. This made it tough for competitors. 
      They were not just going head-to-head with Microsoft's products—they were 
      also competing against the repository of knowledge accumulating in 
      Microsoft's component libraries.</P>
      <P>By now, you will see that Microsoft was building a rather unique 
      resource. Its approach to software "componentization" allowed the firm to 
      leverage intellectual property across multiple product lines. And it also 
      made it attractive for third-party firms to leverage Microsoft's platform, 
      as opposed to others. But how did this allow the firm to respond 
      effectively to technological change? First, it had an established base of 
      knowledge that could be brought to bear on newly emerging opportunities. 
      Second, it had a well-defined process through which <I>new</I> 
      intellectual property could be codified and integrated into this knowledge 
      base in a way that ensured compatibility with its existing components. And 
      third, it established processes to <I>evolve</I> this knowledge base to 
      ensure it reflected changes in the broader technological context. For 
      example, the programming model was updated in the early 1990s to reflect 
      the increasing use of networks. Then later in the 1990s, Microsoft once 
      again began "re-architecting" its component base to facilitate the 
      delivery of "Web services," applications that can be activated remotely 
      over the Internet.</P>

      <P>Putting this all together, we see that much of Microsoft's long-term 
      success can be attributed to investments that have created "dynamic 
      capabilities" for responding to technological change. These investments 
      include: the <I>process</I> of software componentization through which it 
      captures and embeds intellectual property in an accessible form; the 
      <I>component libraries</I> that result from this process, which form a 
      vast repository of knowledge that can be leveraged across its product 
      lines; a <I>programming model</I> that allows developers, both inside and 
      outside the firm, to access these components through well-defined 
      interfaces; and the process through which both its software components and 
      programming model are updated to reflect developments in the broader 
      technological context.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=article-interview><B>Q: </B>Microsoft has been criticized 
      as a company that relies more on predatory tactics than great products and 
      innovation to succeed. What can you say about Microsoft's product 
      development performance over the years?</SPAN></P>
      <P><B>A: </B>We analyzed the development performance of Microsoft products 
      for the past fifteen years. Our aim was to come up with an objective 
      measure of performance—one that was unrelated to arguments about market 
      power, monopoly position, or predatory tactics. This meant we excluded any 
      consideration of measures like market share or profitability, and focused 
      instead on the ratings given to Microsoft products by independent 
      reviewers. We found that Microsoft products were consistently rated highly 
      when compared to competitive offerings, a result that held true across 
      different product categories and over time. On average, Microsoft products 
      "won" more than two-thirds of the competitive reviews we examined. Indeed, 
      only once in fifteen years did Microsoft products fail to win more than 
      50% of these reviews. Given the number and diversity of competitors they 
      faced in each different product category, this consistently high 
      performance is striking.</P>

      <P>We also evaluated Microsoft's response to a "technological 
      transition"—a major change in the industry that required the firm to 
      rethink its strategy. We chose to examine the rise of the World Wide Web, 
      given that this transition brought about the rise of a new product 
      category—the Web browser. Microsoft therefore needed to develop a product 
      based on technologies with which it had little previous experience. Our 
      analysis focused on Microsoft's first two internal browser development 
      projects, comparing their performance to a sample of Internet software 
      projects completed at the same time. We discovered that Microsoft's 
      projects exhibited significantly higher productivity than the sample 
      average. Furthermore, we found that the resulting products were rated as 
      equal to or higher in quality than competitive offerings. These results 
      often surprise people, given the perceived wisdom that incumbents have 
      difficulty responding to major technological changes.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=article-interview><B>Q: </B>Microsoft was originally late 
      in its embrace of the Internet. Yet Bill Gates was able to quickly change 
      strategy to allow the company to become a top competitor in selling 
      Internet-related technologies and services. How did Microsoft accomplish 
      this?</SPAN></P>
      <P><B>A: </B>In any industry subject to rapid technological change, a firm 
      faces two big challenges. The first is in <I>recognizing</I> the threats 
      (and opportunities) presented by newly emerging technologies. The second 
      is in mounting an effective <I>response</I> to these threats. Microsoft 
      appears to have solved these problems, giving it the ability to quickly 
      adapt to changing circumstances. The way they have tackled each however, 
      differs in nature.</P>
      <P>In terms of recognizing potential threats, Microsoft has built-in 
      "sensing" mechanisms to keep abreast of what is happening in the broader 
      technological context. Much of this ability comes from their tools 
      division, which tracks the needs of the many developers worldwide who 
      write for Microsoft platforms. When these developers find attractive 
      alternatives to Microsoft technologies—as they did when the Internet first 
      emerged—it's not long before the tools division starts to hear about it. 
      You also have to realize that Microsoft has several thousand developers 
      inside the company who are constantly examining the potential of new 
      technologies—"lead users" if you like. When all these sources start 
      telling you the same thing, it's hard not to pay attention. Even if it 
      takes a while to work out exactly what should be done.</P>
      <P>In terms of responding to potential threats, Microsoft consistently 
      plays to its strengths—its overall platform strategy, its existing 
      knowledge base, and its process of componentization. For example, when 
      developing the new Internet Explorer browser, the development team opted 
      to leverage its existing programming model, despite the fact that this 
      would initially slow the project down. From this point on, competitors in 
      the browser space faced a formidable challenge—they were competing not 
      only against the Explorer team, but also against the continual 
      improvements made to Microsoft's underlying platform over its many years 
      of existence.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=article-interview><B>Q: </B>What should company leaders 
      everywhere take away from your research in terms of how to compete in the 
      middle of a technological revolution? </SPAN></P>
      <P>Our research highlights two major themes. The first is the importance 
      of taking a proactive approach to managing the development of a firm's 
      intellectual property. We're not talking about patenting strategies here, 
      but rather the set of processes that contribute to building and evolving a 
      firm's knowledge base. These processes fall into four categories: 
      creation/codification; integration/assimilation; application/exploitation; 
      and evolution/adaptation. Inside Microsoft and other successful firms 
      we've studied, managers give careful consideration to how each of these 
      activities is conducted. In doing so, they pay explicit attention to the 
      way these activities interact with processes that leverage the resulting 
      intellectual property assets (e.g., product development).</P>

      <P>The second theme that emerges from our work is the importance of 
      architecture. This theme emerges at multiple levels—in the design of 
      Microsoft's products, its platforms, and its intellectual property. At the 
      product and platform level, the key idea is that in today's networked 
      economy, no firm can remain an island. Technological innovations are 
      increasingly brought to the market by networks of firms, each focused on 
      only specific pieces of the overall puzzle. Competition takes place both 
      between competing platforms and between products that build on top of 
      these platforms. Managers must therefore make explicit choices about the 
      technology architectures they adopt, deciding what to "design/make" 
      themselves, and what to rely upon others to provide.</P>
      <P>With regard to developing intellectual property, our work demonstrates 
      the need for an architectural framework that defines how the various 
      building blocks of IP should fit together. Without such a framework, these 
      efforts are likely to be fragmented and difficult to integrate. At 
      Microsoft, this role is performed by its programming model, which 
      describes the interfaces through which its software components can be 
      accessed. Critically, this model is designed to be flexible enough to 
      facilitate future evolutions in content, as required to reflect changes in 
      the broader technological context.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=article-interview><B>Q: </B>Gates has said, and history 
      suggests, that Microsoft one day will fail. What will be the company's 
      downfall? </SPAN></P>
      <P><B>A: </B>If we knew the answer to this question, we'd be rich! </P>
      <P>Slightly more seriously, the main threat probably comes from competing 
      platforms—alternative systems that enable large numbers of developers to 
      form competing innovation ecosystems. These other platforms, promoted by 
      competitors such as Sun and IBM, are currently strong alternatives to 
      Windows and the Microsoft Developer Network. One of the most interesting 
      is the Linux/open source platform. This platform has recently become 
      associated with IBM, which has invested resources in its development and 
      extension, and used it to promote complementary hardware, software, and 
      services. However, this is less a story of sudden dramatic failure and 
      more a story of ongoing competition at the platform level. The presence of 
      competing platforms like Linux requires that Microsoft continue to invest 
      in its IP base and integrate new innovations into its own platform. If it 
      fails to do this, it will be certain to lose out to alternatives.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=article-interview><B>Q: </B>What is the next stage of your 
      research?</SPAN></P>
      <P><B>A: </B>We have two ongoing streams. The first is additional work 
      with Microsoft and others in the software industry that have adopted 
      similar approaches to managing intellectual property. The aim is to 
      develop a blueprint for the most important processes (e.g., 
      componentization) as well as to assess how we can measure the resources 
      created and the changes subsequently made to these resources to reflect 
      the broader technological context. Our hypothesis is that if we look at 
      the evolution of Microsoft's component base, we'll see greater amounts of 
      change around the time of major technological change, such as the rise of 
      the Internet.</P>
      <P>The second stream of research seeks to extend our work into 
      non-software industries, to understand how the dynamics might differ. For 
      example, how would Microsoft's approach translate to the semiconductor 
      industry or the biotechnology industry? Both industries share similarities 
      with software, in that firms codify their intellectual property into 
      libraries that can be reused and extended over time. But do we observe the 
      same dynamics in terms of firm performance? And can we identify similar 
      processes and resources inside these firms? As you can see, we have a long 
      way to go. But we believe that this stream of research has the potential 
      to change the way we think about how firms develop capabilities for 
      competing in environments of rapid technological change.</P><!--
