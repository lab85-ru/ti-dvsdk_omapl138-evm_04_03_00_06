 *  Provides APIs to protect critical sections when an IGate.Handle is

  * An application can isolate itself from IGate implementations by using 
 *  this module. The application must first obtain an IGate.Handle. 
 *  It can get such a handle by directly calling {@link GateThread#create} or 
 *  {@link GateProcess#create}. Then the application can use the generic 
 *  APIs provided by this module.
 *
 *  The underlying gates are nexting in nature and users have to leave 
 *  the gate as many times as they entered it.
