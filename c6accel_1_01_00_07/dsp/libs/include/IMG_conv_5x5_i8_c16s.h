/*      The convolution kernel accepts five rows of 'pitch' input pixels    */
/*      and produces one row of 'width' output pixels using the input       */
/*      mask of 5 by 5. This convolution performs a point by point mult-    */
/*      iplication of 5 by 5 mask with the input image. The result of 25    */
/*      multiplications are then summed together to produce a 32-bit conv-  */
/*      olution intermediate sum. The user defined shift value is used to   */
/*      shift this convolution sum, down to the byte range and store in an  */
/*      output array. The result being stored is also range limited between */
/*      0 to 255 and will be saturated accordingly. The mask is moved one   */
/*      column at a time, advancing the mask over the entire image until    */
/*      the entire 'width' is covered. The masks are provided as 16-bit     */
/*      signed values. The input image pixels are provided as 8-bit uns-    */
/*      igned pixels and the output pixels will be in 8-bit unsigned.       */
