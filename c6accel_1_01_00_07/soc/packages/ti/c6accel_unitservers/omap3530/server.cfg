 *  ======== DSKT2 (xDAIS Alg. memory allocation) configuration ========
 *
 *  DSKT2 is the memory manager for all algorithms running in the system,
 *  granting them persistent and temporary ("scratch") internal and external
 *  memory. We configure it here to define its memory allocation policy.
 *
 *  DSKT2 settings are critical for algorithm performance.
 *
 *  First we assign various types of algorithm internal memory (DARAM0..2,
 *  SARAM0..2,IPROG, which are all the same on a C64+ DSP) to "L1DHEAP"
 *  defined in the .tcf file as an internal memory heap. (For instance, if
 *  an algorithm asks for 5K of DARAM1 memory, DSKT2 will allocate 5K from
 *  L1DHEAP, if available, and give it to the algorithm; if the 5K is not
 *  available in the L1DHEAP, that algorithm's creation will fail.)
 *
 *  The remaining segments we point to the "DDRALGHEAP" external memory segment
 *  (also defined in the.tcf) except for DSKT2_HEAP which stores DSKT2's
 *  internal dynamically allocated objects, which must be preserved even if
 *  no codec instances are running, so we place them in "DDR2" memory segment
 *  with the rest of system code and static data.

/*
 *  Next we define how to fulfill algorithms' requests for fast ("scratch")
 *  internal memory allocation; "scratch" is an area an algorithm writes to
 *  while it processes a frame of data and is discarded afterwards.
 *
 *  First we turn off the switch that allows the DSKT2 algorithm memory manager
 *  to give to an algorithm external memory for scratch if the system has run
 *  out of internal memory. In that case, if an algorithm fails to get its
 *  requested scratch memory, it will fail at creation rather than proceed to
 *  run at poor performance. (If your algorithms fail to create, you may try
 *  changing this value to "true" just to get it running and optimize other
 *  scratch settings later.)
 *
 *  Setting "algorithm scratch sizes", is a scheme we use to minimize internal
 *  memory resources for algorithms' scratch memory allocation. Algorithms that
 *  belong to the same "scratch group ID" -- field "groupId" in the algorithm's
 *  Server.algs entry above, reflecting the priority of the task running the
 *  algorithm -- don't run at the same time and thus can share the same
 *  scratch area. When creating the first algorithm in a given "scratch group"
 *  (between 0 and 19), a shared scratch area for that groupId is created with
 *  a size equal to SARAM_SCRATCH_SIZES[<alg's groupId>] below -- unless the
 *  algorithm requests more than that number, in which case the size will be
 *  what the algorithm asks for. So SARAM_SCRATCH_SIZES[<alg's groupId>] size is
 *  more of a groupId size guideline -- if the algorithm needs more it will get
 *  it, but getting these size guidelines right is important for optimal use of
 *  internal memory. The reason for this is that if an algorithm comes along
 *  that needs more scratch memory than its groupId scratch area's size, it
 *  will get that memory allocated separately, without sharing.
 *
 *  This DSKT2.SARAM_SCRATCH_SIZES[<groupId>] does not mean it is a scratch size
 *  that will be automatically allocated for the group <groupId> at system
 *  startup, but only that is a preferred minimum scratch size to use for the
 *  first algorithm that gets created in the <groupId> group, if any.
 *
 *  (An example: if algorithms A and B with the same groupId = 0 require 10K and
 *  20K of scratch, and if SARAM_SCRATCH_SIZES[0] is 0, if A gets created first
 *  DSKT2 allocates a shared scratch area for group 0 of size 10K, as A needs.
 *  If then B gets to be created, the 20K scratch area it gets will not be
 *  shared with A's -- or anyone else's; the total internal memory use will be
 *  30K. By contrast, if B gets created first, a 20K shared scratch will be
 *  allocated, and when A comes along, it will get its 10K from the existing
 *  group 0's 20K area. To eliminate such surprises, we set
 *  SARAM_SCRATCH_SIZES[0] to 20K and always spend exactly 20K on A and B's
 *  shared needs -- independent of their creation order. Not only do we save 10K
 *  of precious internal memory, but we avoid the possibility that B can't be
 *  created because less than 20K was available in the DSKT2 internal heaps.)
 *
 *  Finally, note that if the codecs correctly implement the
 *  ti.sdo.ce.ICodec.getDaramScratchSize() and .getSaramScratchSize() methods,
 *  this scratch size configuration can be autogenerated by
 *  configuring Server.autoGenScratchSizeArrays = true.

/*
 *  ======== DMAN3 (DMA manager) configuration ========
 */

/*  First we configure how DMAN3 handles memory allocations:
 *
 *  Essentially the configuration below should work for most codec combinations.
 *  If it doesn't work for yours -- meaning an algorithm fails to create due
 *  to insufficient internal memory -- try the alternative (commented out
 *  line that assigns "DDRALGHEAP" to DMAN3.heapInternal).
 *
 *  What follows is an FYI -- an explanation for what the alternative would do:
 *
 *  When we use an external memory segment (DDRALGHEAP) for DMAN3 internal
 *  segment, we force algorithms to use external memory for what they think is
 *  internal memory -- we do this in a memory-constrained environment
 *  where all internal memory is used by cache and/or algorithm scratch
 *  memory, pessimistically assuming that if DMAN3 uses any internal memory,
 *  other components (algorithms) will not get the internal memory they need.
 *
 *  This setting would affect performance very lightly.
 *
 *  By setting DMAN3.heapInternal = <external-heap>  DMAN3 *may not* supply
 *  ACPY3_PROTOCOL IDMA3 channels the protocol required internal memory for
 *  IDMA3 channel 'env' memory. To deal with this catch-22 situation we
 *  configure DMAN3 with hook-functions to obtain internal-scratch memory
 *  from the shared scratch pool for the associated algorithm's
 *  scratch-group (i.e. it first tries to get the internal scratch memory
 *  from DSKT2 shared allocation pool, hoping there is enough extra memory
 *  in the shared pool, if that doesn't work it will try persistent
 *  allocation from DMAN3.internalHeap).
